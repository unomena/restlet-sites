   <h2><a name="part01">1. Restlet overview</a></h2>

   <p>
      The Restlet framework is composed of two main parts. First, there
      is the "<a href="api/">Restlet API</a>", a
      neutral API supporting the concepts of REST and facilitating the
      handling of calls for both client-side and server-side applications.
      This API is backed by the Restlet Engine and both are now shipped 
      in a single JAR ("org.restlet.jar").
   </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial01" alt="Framework structure" />
   </p>
   <p>
      This separation between the API and the implementation is similar
      to the one between the Servlet API and Web containers like Jetty or
      Tomcat, or between the JDBC API and concrete JDBC drivers.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part02">2. Retrieving the content of a Web page</a></h2>

   <p>
      As we mentioned in the <a href="/about/introduction">introduction paper</a>,
      the Restlet framework is at the same time a client and a server framework.
      For example, Restlet can easily work with remote resources using its HTTP
      client connector. A connector in REST is a software element that enables
      the communication between components, typically by implementing one side
      of a network protocol. Restlet provides several implementations of client
      connectors based on existing open-source projects. The <a href="connectors">connectors</a>
      section lists all available client and server connectors and explain how
      to use and configure them.
   </p>
   <p>
      Here we will get the representation of an
      existing resource and output it in the JVM console:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Outputting the content of a Web page
new ClientResource("http://www.restlet.org").get().write(System.out);
   </pre>

   <p>
      Note that the example above uses a simplified way to issue calls
      via the ClientResource class. If you need multi-threading or more
      control it is still possible to manipulate use the Client connector 
      class or the Request objects directly. The example below  how to set 
      some preferences in your client call, like a referrer URI. It could 
      also be the languages and media types you prefer to receive as a 
      response:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Create the client resource
ClientResource resource = new ClientResource("http://www.restlet.org");

// Customize the referrer property
resource.setReferrerRef("http://www.mysite.org");

// Write the response entity on the console
resource.get().write(System.out);
   </pre>

   <h2><a name="part03">3. Listening to Web browsers</a></h2>

   <p>
      Now, we want to see how the Restlet framework can listen to
      client requests and reply to them. We will use the internal Restlet HTTP
      server connector (even though it is possible to switch to others such as 
      the one based on Mortbay's Jetty) and return a simple string representation
      "hello, world" as plain text. Note that the Part03 class extends the base
      ServerResource class provided by Restlet:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
public class Part03 extends ServerResource {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create the HTTP server and listen on port 8182
        new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8182, Part03.class).start();
    }

    @Get
    public String toString() {
        return "hello, world";
    }

}
   </pre>

   <p>
      If you run this code and launch your server, you can open a Web
      browser and hit the <a href="http://localhost:8182">http://localhost:8182</a>.
      Actually, any URI will work, try also
      <a href="http://localhost:8182/test/tutorial">http://localhost:8182/test/tutorial</a>.
      Note that if you test your server from a different machine, you need to
      replace "localhost" by either the IP address of your server or its
      domain name if it has one defined.
   </p>
   
   <p>
        So far, we have mostly showed you the highest level of abstraction in
        the Restlet API, with the ClientResource and ServerResource classes.
        But as we move forward, you will discover that those two classes are
        supported by a rich API, letting you manipulate all the REST artifacts.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part04">4. Overview of a REST architecture</a></h2>

   <p>
      Let's step back a little and consider typical web architectures
      from a REST point of view. In the diagram below, ports represent the
      connector that enables the communication between components which are
      represented by the larger boxes. The links represents the particular
      protocol (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) used for the actual communication.
   </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial04" alt="REST architecture" />
   </p>

   <p>
      Note that the same component can have any number of client and
      server connectors attached to it. Web Server B, for example, has both a
      server connector to respond to requests from the User Agent component,
      and client connectors to send requests to Web Server A and the Mail
      Server.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part05">5. Components, virtual hosts and applications</a></h2>

   <p>
      In addition to supporting the standard REST software architecture
      elements as presented before, the Restlet framework also provides a set
      of classes that greatly simplify the hosting of multiple applications
      within a single JVM. The goal is to provide a RESTful, portable and more
      flexible alternative to the existing Servlet API. In the diagram below,
      we can see the three types of Restlets that are provided in order to
      manage these complex cases. Components can manage several Virtual Hosts
      and Applications.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Virtual Hosts support flexible configuration where,
      for example, the same IP address is shared by several domain names, or
      where the same domain name is load-balanced across several IP addresses.
      Finally, we use Applications to manage a set of related Restlets,
      Resources and Representations. In addition, Applications are ensured to
      be portable and reconfigurable over different Restlet implementations
      and with different virtual hosts. In addition, they provide important
      services like access logging, automatic decoding of request entities,
      configurable status page setting and more!
   </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial05" alt="Restlet components, virtual hosts and applications" />
   </p>

   <p>
      In order to illustrate these classes, let's examine a simple
      example. Here we create a Component, then add an HTTP server connector
      to it, listening on port 8182. Then we create a simple trace Restlet and
      attach it to the defaut VirtualHost of the Component. This default host
      is catching any request that wasn't already routed to a declared
      VirtualHost (see the Component.hosts property for details). In a later
      example, we will also introduce the usage of the Application class. Note
      that for now you don't see any access log displayed in the console.
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Create a new Restlet component and add a HTTP server connector to it
    Component component = new Component();
    component.getServers().add(Protocol.HTTP, 8182);

    // Then attach it to the local host
    component.getDefaultHost().attach("/trace", Part05.class);

    // Now, let's start the component!
    // Note that the HTTP server connector is also automatically started.
    component.start();
}

@Get
public String toString() {
    // Print the requested URI path
    return "Resource URI  : " + getReference() + '\n' + "Root URI      : "
            + getRootRef() + '\n' + "Routed part   : "
            + getReference().getBaseRef() + '\n' + "Remaining part: "
            + getReference().getRemainingPart();
}
   </pre>

   <p>
      Now let's test it by entering <a
         href="http://localhost:8182/trace/abc/def?param=123">http://localhost:8182/trace/abc/def?param=123</a>
      in a Web browser. Here is the result that you will get:
   </p>

   <pre>
Resource URI  : http://localhost:8182/trace/abc/def?param=123
Root URI      : http://localhost:8182/trace
Routed part   : http://localhost:8182/trace
Remaining part: /abc/def?param=123
   </pre>

   <h2><a name="part06">6. Serving static files</a></h2>

   <p>
      Do you have a part of your web application that serves static
      pages like Javadocs? Well, no need to setup an Apache server just for
      that, use instead the dedicated Directory class. See how simple it is to
      use it:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// URI of the root directory.
public static final String ROOT_URI = "file:///c:/restlet/docs/api/";

[...]

// Create a component
Component component = new Component();
component.getServers().add(Protocol.HTTP, 8182);
component.getClients().add(Protocol.FILE);

// Create an application
Application application = new Application() {
    @Override
    public Restlet createInboundRoot() {
            return new Directory(getContext(), ROOT_URI);
    }
};

// Attach the application to the component and start it
component.getDefaultHost().attach(application);
component.start();
   </pre>

   <p>
      In order to run this example, you need to specify a valid value
      for ROOT_URI, In this case, it is set to "file:///c:/restlet/docs/api/".
      Note that no additional configuration is needed. If you want to customize 
      the mapping between file extensions and metadata (media type, language or 
      encoding) or if you want to specify a different index name, you can use the
      Application's <a
         href="api/org/restlet/service/MetadataService.html">"metadataService"</a>
      property.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part07">7. Access logging</a></h2>

   <p>
      Being able to properly log the activity of a Web application is a
      common requirement. Restlet Components know by default how to generate
      Apache-like logs or even custom ones. By taking advantage of the logging
      facility built in the JDK, the logger can be configured like any
      standard JDK log to filter messages, reformat them or specify where to
      send them. Rotation of logs is also supported; see the <a
         href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">java.util.logging</a>
      package for details.</p>
      <p>Note that you can customize the logger name given to the
      java.util.logging framework by modifying the Component's "logService"
      property. In order to fully configure the logging, you need to declare a
      configuration file by setting a system property like:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
System.setProperty("java.util.logging.config.file",
        "/your/path/logging.config");
   </pre>
   <p>
      For details on the configuration file format, please check the <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/logging/LogManager.html">JDK's
      LogManager</a> class.
   </p>
   
   <p>You can also have a look at the 
      <a href="http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/101-restlet.html">Restlet 2.0 logging documentation</a>.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part08">8. Displaying error pages</a></h2>

   <p>
      Another common requirement is the ability to customize the status
      pages returned when something didn't go as expected during the call
      handling. Maybe a resource was not found or an acceptable representation
      isn't available? In this case, or when any unhandled exception is be
      intercepted, the Application or the Component will automatically provide
      a default status page for you. This service is associated to the
      org.restlet.util.StatusService class, which is accessible as an
      Application and Component property called "statusService".
   </p>

   <p>
      In order to customize the default messages, you will simply need
      to create a subclass of StatusService and override the
      getRepresentation(Status, Request, Response) method. Then just set an
      instance of your custom service to the appropriate "statusService"
      property.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part09">9. Guarding access to sensitive resources</a></h2>

   <p>
      When you need to secure the access to some Restlets, several
      options are available. A common way is to rely on cookies to identify
      clients (or client sessions) and to check a given user ID or session ID
      against your application state to determine if access should be granted.
      Restlets natively support cookies via the <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Cookie.html">Cookie</a>
      and <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/CookieSetting.html">CookieSetting</a>
      objects accessible from a <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Request.html">Request</a>
      or a <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Response.html">Response</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
      There is another way based on the standard HTTP authentication
      mechanism. The Restlet Engine currently accepts credentials sent
      and received in the Basic HTTP scheme and also the credentials sent in
      the Amazon Web Services scheme.
   </p>

   <p>
      When receiving a call, developers can use the parsed credentials
      available in Request.challengeResponse.identifier/secret via the 
      ChallengeAuthenticator filter. Filters are specialized Restlets that 
      can pre-process a call before invoking and attached Restlet or post-process 
      a call after the attached Restlet returns it. If you are familiar with the 
      Servlet API, the concept is similar to the <a
         href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html">Filter</a>
      interface. See below how we would modify the previous example to secure
      the access to the Directory:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Create a simple password verifier
MapVerifier verifier = new MapVerifier();
verifier.getLocalSecrets().put("scott", "tiger".toCharArray());

// Create a Guard
ChallengeAuthenticator guard = new ChallengeAuthenticator(
                getContext(), ChallengeScheme.HTTP_BASIC, "Tutorial");
guard.setVerifier(verifier);

// Create a Directory able to return a deep hierarchy of files
Directory directory = new Directory(getContext(), ROOT_URI);
directory.setListingAllowed(true);
guard.setNext(directory);

return guard;
   </pre>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial09" alt="Call handling flow" /><br />
   </p>

   <p>
      Note that the authentication and authorization decisions are clearly considered 
      as distinct concerns and are fully customizable via dedicated filters that 
      inherit from the Authenticator (such as ChallengeAuthenticator) and 
      the Authorizer abstract classes. Here we simply hard-coded a single 
      user and password couple. In order to test, let's use the client-side 
      Restlet API:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Prepare the request
ClientResource resource = new ClientResource("http://localhost:8182/");

// Add the client authentication to the call
ChallengeScheme scheme = ChallengeScheme.HTTP_BASIC;
ChallengeResponse authentication = new ChallengeResponse(scheme,
        "scott", "tiger");
resource.setChallengeResponse(authentication);

// Send the HTTP GET request
resource.get();

if (resource.getStatus().isSuccess()) {
    // Output the response entity on the JVM console
    resource.getResponseEntity().write(System.out);
} else if (resource.getStatus()
        .equals(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED)) {
    // Unauthorized access
    System.out
            .println("Access authorized by the server, check your credentials");
} else {
    // Unexpected status
    System.out.println("An unexpected status was returned: "
            + resource.getStatus());
}
   </pre>

   <p>
      You can change the user ID or password sent by this test client
      in order to check the response returned by the server. Remember to
      launch the previous Restlet server before starting your client. Note
      that if you test your server from a different machine, you need to
      replace "localhost" by either the IP address of your server or its
      domain name when typing the URI in the browser. The server won't need
      any adjustment due to the usage of a VirtualHost which accepts all types
      of URIs by default.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part10">10. URI rewriting and redirection</a></h2>

   <p>
      Another advantage of the Restlet framework is the built-in
      support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URIs</a>.
      A good description of the importance of proper URI design is given by
      Jacob Nielsen in his <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html">AlertBox</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
      The first tool available is the Redirector, which allows the
      rewriting of a cool URI to another URI, followed by an automatic
      redirection. Several types of redirection are supported, the external
      redirection via the client/browser and the connector redirection for
      proxy-like behavior. In the example below, we will define a search
      service for our web site (named "mysite.org") based on Google. The
      "/search" relative URI identifies the search service, accepting some
      keywords via the "kwd" parameter:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Create a root router
Router router = new Router(getContext());

// Create a Redirector to Google search service
String target = "http://www.google.com/search?q=site:mysite.org+{keywords}";
Redirector redirector = new Redirector(getContext(), target,
        Redirector.MODE_CLIENT_TEMPORARY);

// While routing requests to the redirector, extract the "kwd" query
// parameter. For instance :
// http://localhost:8182/search?kwd=myKeyword1+myKeyword2
// will be routed to
// http://www.google.com/search?q=site:mysite.org+myKeyword1%20myKeyword2
Extractor extractor = new Extractor(getContext(), redirector);
extractor.extractQuery("keywords", "kwd", true);

// Attach the extractor to the router
router.attach("/search", extractor);
   </pre>

   <p>
      Note that the Redirector needs three parameters only. The first
      is the parent context, the second one defines how the URI rewriting
      should be done, based on a URI template. This template will be processed
      by the <a href="api/org/restlet/util/Template.html">Template</a>
      class. The third parameter defines the type of redirection; here we
      chose the client redirection, for simplicity purpose.</p>
      <p>Also, we are relying on the Route class to extract the query
      parameter "kwd" from the initial request while the call is routed to the
      application. If the parameter is found, it is copied into the request
      attribute named "keywords", ready to be used by the Redirector when
      formatting its target URIs.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="part11">11. Routers and hierarchical URIs</a></h2>

   <p>
      In addition to the Redirector, we have another tool to manage
      cool URIs: Routers. They are specialized Restlets that can have other
      Restlets (Finders and Filters for example) attached to them and that can
      automatically delegate calls based on a <a
         href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI template</a>.
      In general, you will set a Router as the root of your Application.
   </p>

   <p>
      Here we want to explain how to handle the following URI patterns:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>/docs/ to display static files</li>
      <li>/users/{user} to display a user account</li>
      <li>/users/{user}/orders to display the orders of a particular user</li>
      <li>/users/{user}/orders/{order} to display a specific order</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      The fact that these URIs contain variable parts (between
      accolades) and that no file extension is used makes it harder to handle
      them in a typical Web container. Here, you just need to attach target
      Restlets to a Router using the URI template. At runtime, the route that
      best matches the request URI will received the call and be able to
      invoke its attached Restlet. At the same time, the request's attributes
      map will be automatically updated with the value of the URI template
      variables!
   </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial11" alt="Call handling flow" /><br/>
   </p>

   <p>
      See the implementation code below. In a real application, you
      will probably want to create separate subclasses instead of the
      anonymous ones we use here:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Create a root router
Router router = new Router(getContext());

// Attach a guard to secure access to the directory
Guard guard = new Guard(getContext(), ChallengeScheme.HTTP_BASIC,
        "Restlet tutorial");
guard.getSecrets().put("scott", "tiger".toCharArray());
router.attach("/docs/", guard);

// Create a directory able to expose a hierarchy of files
Directory directory = new Directory(getContext(), ROOT_URI);
guard.setNext(directory);

// Create the account handler
Restlet account = new Restlet() {
    @Override
    public void handle(Request request, Response response) {
        // Print the requested URI path
        String message = "Account of user \""
                + request.getAttributes().get("user") + "\"";
        response.setEntity(message, MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
    }
};

// Create the orders handler
Restlet orders = new Restlet(getContext()) {
    @Override
    public void handle(Request request, Response response) {
        // Print the user name of the requested orders
        String message = "Orders of user \""
                + request.getAttributes().get("user") + "\"";
        response.setEntity(message, MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
    }
};

// Create the order handler
Restlet order = new Restlet(getContext()) {
    @Override
    public void handle(Request request, Response response) {
        // Print the user name of the requested orders
        String message = "Order \""
                + request.getAttributes().get("order")
                + "\" for user \""
                + request.getAttributes().get("user") + "\"";
        response.setEntity(message, MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
    }
};

// Attach the handlers to the root router
router.attach("/users/{user}", account);
router.attach("/users/{user}/orders", orders);
router.attach("/users/{user}/orders/{order}", order);
   </pre>

   <p>
      Note that the routing assumes that your request contains an absolute target
      URI that identifies a target resource. During the request processing the
      resource's base URI is continuously updated, for each level in the hierarchy
      of routers. This explains why the default behavior of routers is to match
      only the beginning of the remaining URI part and not the totality of it.
      In some cases, you might want to change this default mode, and this
      is easy to do via the "defaultMatchingMode" property on Router, or by
      modifying the "matchingMode" property of the template associated with the
      route created by the Router.attach() methods. For the modes, you can use the
      Template.MODE_EQUALS or Template.MODE_STARTS_WITH constants.
   </p>

   <p>
      Please note that the values of the variables are directly extracted from
      the URI and are therefore not percent-decoded. In order to achieve such a
      task, have a look to the
      <a href="api/org/restlet/data/Reference.html#decode(java.lang.String)" title="Reference#decode(String)">Reference#decode(String)</a>
      method.

   <p>
      In the previous example, we took advantage of the flexible
      routing features of the framework to route the requests while extracting
      interesting parts from the target URI. But, we didn't pay attention to
      the request method, nor to the client preferences regarding the response
      that he expects. Also, how do we connect our Restlet resources with the
      backend systems, the domain objects?
   </p>

   <p>
      So far, we introduced features that go beyond the traditional
      Servlet API and introduced our support for REST that justify our Restlet 
      name! If  haven't done so already, you can learn more about the
      REST architecture style and the best practices to follow when applying
      it to a Web application. There is a related <a href="/about/faq#04">FAQ entry</a>
      that will give you some starting pointers and we also maintain a <a
      href="http://search.onrest.org">REST search engine</a> (based on
      Google) that can be useful. If you have some experience with a
      traditional MVC framework, you can read more about the relationship to
      Restlets in this other <a href="faq#10">FAQ
      entry</a>.

   <p>
      To summarize, a request contains an URI that identifies the
      target resource that is the subject of the call. This information is
      stored in the Request.resourceRef property and serves as the basis of
      the routing as we saw. So the first goal when handling a request is to
      find the target resource which is in the framework... an instance of the
      ServerResource class or more precisely one of its subclasses. To help us in
      this task, we can use the dedicated Finder, a subclass of Restlet, which
      takes a ServerResource class reference as an argument and which will
      automatically instantiate it when a request comes in. The resource will
      dynamically dispatch the call to either a matching annotated method or to
      a predefined method (get(), post(), put(), delete(), etc.). Of course, 
      this behavior can be customized. There is even an attach() method on Router 
      that can take two arguments, an URI template and a ServerResource class and 
      that transparently creates the Finder for you. Now, let's have a look at 
      this overall diagram, showing the relationship between the main framework 
      classes involved in this example:
   </p>

   <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="images/tutorial12" alt="Component diagram" /><br />
   </p>

   <p>
      Back to the code, here is our refactored Application.createRoot()
      method. For simplicity purpose, we didn't keep the Directory serving
      static files as this part wouldn't change. You can notice the way that
      resource classes are directly attached to the router.
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
// Create a router
Router router = new Router(getContext());

// Attach the resources to the router
router.attach("/users/{user}", UserResource.class);
router.attach("/users/{user}/orders", OrdersResource.class);
router.attach("/users/{user}/orders/{order}", OrderResource.class);
   </pre>

   <p>
      We will finally review one of the resource classes, the UserResource class. 
      This class derives from org.restlet.resource.ServerResource. We override the
      init() method to retrieve the attribute "user" that is automatically extracted 
      from the "/users/{user}" URI template and store its value in a convenient member
      variable. At this point, in a full application, we would lookup our
      associated "user" domain object. Finally, we declare a toString() method that
      supports the GET method as indicated by the @Get annotation.
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
public class UserResource extends ServerResource {
    String userName;

    Object user;

    @Override
    public void init() {
        this.userName = (String) getRequestAttributes().get("user");
        this.user = null; // Could be a lookup to a domain object.
    }

    @Get
    public String toString() {
        return "Account of user \"" + this.userName + "\"";
    }
}
   </pre>

   <p>
      You can have a look at the rest of the code in the tutorial
      package and test the application. You will obtain the same behavior as
      in Part11, with the difference that only GET requests will be accepted.
      If you want to enable PUT for example, you have to create a Java method
      in UserResource and annotate it with @Put. You can check the Javadocs 
      for further details.

   <h2><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

   <p>
      We have already covered many aspects of the framework. Before you
      move on by yourself, let's take a step back and look at two hierarchy
      diagrams showing the main concepts covered in this tutorial and their
      relationships:
