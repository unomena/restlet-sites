Introduction
============

[This
book](http://restlet.org/documentation/books#restful-web-services)
is the first one dedicated to REST. It is authored by Leonard Richardson
and Sam Ruby and published by O'Reilly.

For now, please find the [source
code](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/1.1/examples/books/rest/src.zip)
of all the book examples that were reimplemented using Restlets. Those
examples are also available and the Restlet distributions under the
"src/org.restlet.example" directory.
