Mapping HTTP headers
====================

Introduction
============

The Restlet API offers a higher level view of the HTTP protocol. It
tries to abstract and present in a clean object model, the
application-level semantics of HTTP. As a side feature, it is possible
to map other protocols to the same semantics, such as FILE, FTP, SMTP,
etc.

However, developers often know lower-level details of HTTP or need to
understand them for debugging purpose. This is the reason for this
document, explaining the mapping between the HTTP semantics and the
Restlet API.

Note that the headers that are not supported yet can still be overridden
via the "org.restlet.http.headers" attribute of the request or the
response. A warning message is  logged : "Addition of the standard
header "XXX" is discouraged. Future versions of the Restlet API will
directly support it".

See details in the Javadocs of the
[Message.getAttributes()](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.1/jse/api/org/restlet/Message.html#getAttributes%28%29)
method.
