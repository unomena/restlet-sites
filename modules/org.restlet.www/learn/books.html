		</h4>
		<p>
			<i>Restlet in Action</i> gets you started with the Restlet Framework
			and the REST architecture style. You'll create and deploy applications
			in record time while learning to use popular RESTful Web APIs
			effectively. This book looks at the many faces of web development,
			including server- and client-side, along with cloud computing, mobile
			Android devices, and semantic web applications. It offers a particular
			focus on Google's innovative Google Web Toolkit, Google App Engine,
			and Android technologies.
		</p>
		<p>The book takes you though a comprehensive presentation of
			Restlet's main features, including subjects like security, testing and
			automatic documentation. You'll learn while following the typical
			Restlet development process, with consistent illustrations based on a
			sample RESTful email app.</p>

		<p>
			In this milestone book, <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard
				Richardson</a> and <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam
				Ruby</a> guide you through a revealing journey inside the architecture of
			the Web. Using concrete examples, they help you to use HTTP, URIs and
			REST at their full potential.
		</p>
	
		<p>A design process called Resource Oriented Architecture provides
			a pragmatic application of REST principles and best practices based on
			findings from the REST community. Importantly, this book is also the
			first one to significantly cover the Restlet framework, providing a
			good opportunity to compare it to other frameworks like Ruby on Rails
			and django. A must read for all REST and Restlet enthousiasts!

		<p>RESTful Web applications are very scalable in nature and the
			Restlet framework lets you fully take advantage of this REST
			architectural feature throught multi-threading and a session-free
			design. Still, you need to be aware of the Java concurrency best
			practices when designing your Restlet applications.
		</p>
	
		<p>This book was written by the team how designed the new
			concurrency features added to Java 5 and Java 6. It has four parts:
			Fundamentals, Structuring Concurrent Applications, Liveness,
			Performance, and Testing, Advanced Topics.

		<p>While Restlet was designed to perfectly match the REST concepts,
			great care was also taken when transposing those concepts into a clean
			Java API. Among the various sources available on Java API design best
			practices, this book comes out as a clear winner. Each one of the 78
			rules proposed is clearly explained, with pros and cons put in a
			balance and clarified with examples.
		</p>
		<p>This book was written by Joshua Bloch, chief Java architect at
			Google, and the new edition covers the latest enhancements to the Java
			language such as Generics, Annotations or Enums. Every Restlet as well
			as every Java programmer should have this gem on his bookshelf!

		<p>If you are new to XML or to XML used in Java, this is a useful

			2006, it now covers the most recent XML processing techniques such as
			StaX.
		</p>
		<p>As XML is the most common way to exchange representations in
			RESTful applications, this is an essential piece of technology to
			understand. This will definitely help you while learning REST and the
			Restlet framework which has extensive support for XML.
