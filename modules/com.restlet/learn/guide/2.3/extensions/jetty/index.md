Eclipse Jetty extension
=======================

Introduction
============

This connector is based on the [Eclipse Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)
open-source web server. Jetty is popular alternative to Tomcat developed
by WebTide and has a nice separation between its HTTP
protocol implementation and its support for the Servlet API which led to
the first HTTP server connector developed for the Restlet Framework.

Description
===========

This connector supports the following protocols: HTTP, HTTPS and SPDY on the server-side and HTTP, HTTPS
on the client-side.

The list of supported specific parameters is available in the javadocs:

-   [Jetty common parameters](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/jetty/JettyServerHelper.html)
-   [HTTP specific parameters](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/jetty/HttpServerHelper.html)
-   [HTTPS specific parameters](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/jetty/HttpsServerHelper.html)

Here is the list of dependencies of this connector:

-   [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)
-   [Java Servlet](http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/)

For additional details, please consult the
[Javadocs](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/jetty/package-summary.html).

Usage example
=============

Please consult [connector configuration documentation](../../core/base/connectors)

HTTPS
-----

For general information on Jetty HTTPS/SSL configuration, please read
[this document](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Configure_SSL).
For configuration of the connector in a Restlet component, you will need
to set some of the HTTPS parameters listed above, for example:

    Server server = myComponent.getServers().add(Protocol.HTTPS, 8183);
    server.getContext().getParameters().add("keystorePath", "<your-path>");
    server.getContext().getParameters().add("keystorePassword", "<your-password>");
    server.getContext().getParameters().add("keyPassword", "<your-password>");

SPDY
----

The support for SPDY is disabled by default. In order to use it, you need to add the "spdy.version" parameter to your Jetty HTTPS server configuration with a value of "3" add a special NPN JAR file to the the boot classpath of your JRE 7. See [the instructions here](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/npn-chapter.html).
