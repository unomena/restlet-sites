1. Open the your web API **Overview** page and click on the **Setting** tab.
2. In the **Firewall** section, select **IP filtering**.

3. Enter a **Name** for the limitation you want to set e.g. "rate limitation for consumers (10 minutes)", select the appropriate **Group**, a **Period** and a maximum number of calls (**Limit**).

>**Note:** When you select **All** as a group, you create a rate limitation for every testers and consumers including anonymous users who consume public APIs. Users who signed in are limited by their token when anonymous consumers are limited by their public IP.
>As your users can belong to several groups, the limitation applied will always be the largest one.
