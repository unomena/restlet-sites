# Introduction

The beauty of a RESTful API is that it can easily be invoked by a host of different devices and applications.

To facilitate this, APISpark can generate custom client SDKs (Software Development Kits) for your web APIs for a number of different environments:

- Java
- Android
- GWT
- JavaScript (AJAX or Node.js)
- IOS

# Create and generate a client SDK

APISpark lets API team members automatically create the client kits that will be made available to consumers of the API.

## Create client SDKs

To create a new client kit, go to the web API's **Downloads** tab.

In the left panel, add a new client kit. Give the client kit a name, description (optional), and select the client kit's type. The type corresponds to the target platform for the kit.

## Generate client SDKs

Once a set of client SDKs has been created, their code can be automatically generated by APISpark and made available for download.

To generate the code for all your client SDKs, click on the action button and select **Generate downloads**.

Once the operation completes successfully, the client SDKs you have added to your **Downloads** section will be available for download.

# Download a client SDK

To download a client SDK for a web API:

Select the appropriate API.  
Click on the **Downloads** tab.  
Select the language you need (Java or JavaScript) in the **Client kits** section.  
Click on the **Download** button.
