A web API has a set of **Resources**. Each resource has its own **Path** which is relative to the API's **Endpoints**.

To edit a web API's **Resources**, navigate to the web API's **Overview**. The API's resources are listed in the **Resources** section in the left panel.

The **Search** field can be used to easily filter resources by name.  

To modify the relative path of a resource, click on the appropriate resource in the **Resources** section and enter a new path in the **Relative path** field.

> **Note**: you will need to redeploy your API for any changes to take effect.

# Organising resources in sections

**Sections** allow you to group resources together in order to make it easier for you manage them.

A web API's **Sections** can be managed in the left panel of the **Overview**.

# Resource methods

Every web API **Resource** has a list of associated **Methods**. The methods are HTTP methods, the most commonly used of which are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

To edit a web API's resource **Methods**, select a **Resource** from the left panel.

For each resource, the possible request methods (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE) are displayed underneath.

> **Note**: you will need to redeploy your API for any changes to take effect.
