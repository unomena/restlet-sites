A *Descriptor* is a web API cell.

# Create a Descriptor cell

To create a Descriptor, go to the **Dashboard** and click on the **+Web API** button.

In the **Create a web API** window, select **Descriptor** from the **Type** drop-down menu. You will be prompted to give your Descriptor a **Name** and a **Description** (optional).

A **Descriptor** is composed of **Endpoints**, **Resources**, and **Representations**.

# Describe your web API

Rather than manually create a *Descriptor* from scratch, APISpark provides ways for you to automatically generate one that describes your existing API.

A *Descriptor* can be generated from your current API's Swagger definition, or from your API's Restlet Framework or JAX-RS implementation.

## Generate a Descriptor from a Swagger definition

You can generate a web API Descriptor by importing a Swagger definition for an existing web API, by providing the Swagger definition's URL.

Open an existing Descriptor or create a new one from the Dashboard by clicking on **+ Web API** and selecting **Descriptor** from the drop-down menu.

From the Descriptor's **Overview**, click on the actions button on top right of your screen and select the **Import definition** menu.

You will be prompted to enter the URL that points to your API's Swagger definition.

Click on the **Import** button to import the Swagger definition into your Descriptor. As a result, representations and resources will be added to your Descriptor according to the content of the Swagger definition.

To view the changes, navigate to the Descriptor's **Overview** tab.

> **Note:** Importing several Swagger definitions to the same Descriptor could result in naming conflicts for resource paths or representations. The import wizard will indicate which conflicts need to be resolved.


## Generate a Descriptor with Restlet's code Introspector

The Restlet code introspector is designed to generate a web API Descriptor by introspecting the code of your existing web API implementation.

The introspector supports two types of Java implementations: those based on the Restlet Framework, and those based on JAX-RS. In both, Swagger annotations are supported.

For more information on how to introspect a Restlet Framework application, jump to our [Document an existing Restlet web API](technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/api-for-vendors/document-restlet-api "Document an existing Restlet web API") tutorial.

For more information on how to instrospect a JAX-RS application, jump to our [Document an existing JAX-RS web API](technical-resources/apispark/tutorials/api-for-vendors/document-jax-rs-api "Document an existing JAX-RS web API") tutorial.

After introspecting your JAX-RS code, you can work on your [Descriptor](technical-resources/apispark/guide/document/get-documentation "Descriptor").
