# Introduction

APISpark is built to support team-based collaboration on API projects.

Collaboration in APISpark is based on the capacity to share a cell with other APISpark users, and to attribute specific roles to collaborators based on the functions they carry out.

# Cell Roles

A member can have one of five roles on a cell.

For team-based collaboration, members should be given either of the roles *Owner*, *Manager*, *Operator*, or *Developer*.

*User* is a special role designed for web API members who are consumers of your API. For more information about managing your API consumption, please visit the [User Groups](apispark/guide/publish/secure/user-groups "User Groups") page.

Depending on the role given to a member, he will have different permissions in the APISpark console.

## Team roles

 * **Owner:** a cell's Owner has full rights on it. Each cell has a unique Owner, who is also the Owner of every version of the cell. The Owner's role cannot be modified.

 * **Manager:** a Manager has all but a few rights on a cell. For instance, a manager cannot delete a cell, as this operation is reserved to the Owner and to manage the community of cell members.

 * **Operator:** an Operator has the rights to manage runtime aspects of a cell and to manage a cell's lifecycle.

 * **Developer:** a Developer has rights to the design-time and development aspects of a cell.


## Consumer roles

 * **User:** a User can consult basic information about a web API and be given runtime access rights by being added to a member group.


# Managing cell members

To manage the members of a cell, navigate to the cell's **Members** tab.

From here, you can add delete members, and attribute roles to members.

To add a member to a cell:

1. From the web API **Overview** page, click on the **Members** tab.
2. In the **Members** section, click on the **Add** button.
3. In the window that displays, enter the name or email address of the member you want to add. From the information entered, APISpark will suggest the different accounts created by the member (GitHub, Google Mail, etc.).
4. Select the appropriate account and click on the **Add** button.
5. Select a role for your member in the drop-down menu (Manager, Operator, Developer or User).
