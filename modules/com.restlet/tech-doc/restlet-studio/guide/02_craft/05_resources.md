# Introduction

Each resource has its own address or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Resources should be named using nouns as opposed to verbs or actions. In other words, a URI should refer to a Resource that is an item instead of referring to an action: nouns have properties as verbs do not.  

On Restlet Studio console, you can find the Resources of your API endpoint in the **Resources** section. Click on the appropriate Endpoint and the Resources linked display in the **Resources** section.

# Add a Section

In Restlet Studio, sections can be defined to group resources and representations, very much like packages for Java classes. Sections will allow you to organize the different items of your API.

In the **Sections** section, click on the appropriate section. The resources and representations linked display underneath.
