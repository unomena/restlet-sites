Welcome to the Restlet User Guide.

**Restlet Studio** provides a web console that lets you visually craft web APIs. No need to learn Swagger or RAML syntaxes in JSON or YAML to get started, Restlet Studio generates them for you in addition to server skeletons to bootstrap your API implementation and client SDKs to facilitate the consumption of your API.

This documentation covers all of these topics in detail in order to help you define your APIs and generate your server skeletons and client SDKs.  

To help you start with Restlet Studio, we recommend that you browse through the different sections of this User Guide and find the information you need. Simply click on one of the topics in the menu on the left, or directly start by crafting your API from scratch.
