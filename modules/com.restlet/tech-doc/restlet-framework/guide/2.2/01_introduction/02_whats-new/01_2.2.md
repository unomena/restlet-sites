# Migration guide from version 2.1 to ${restlet-version-minor}

This section intends to explain the main differences between the Restlet
2.1 and 2.2 releases and to help you migrate your existing applications.
Both releases are meant to be compatible at the API level, so you should
at most observe deprecate features while upgrading.

Note that if you intend to migrate directly from 1.1 to ${restlet-version-minor}, you should
really consider migrating first from 1.1 to 2.0. For migration instructions between 1.1 and 2.0,
you can check [this page](../../whats-new/2.0/migration "Migration guide from version 1.1 to 2.0").

## Replace all JAR files

Restlet JARs and dependencies

## Deprecated API features

The next step is to look at each deprecated feature and look in the
Javadocs at the preferred alternative in version ${restlet-version-minor}.
