This section explains how to get started with the Restlet Framework,
including set up and debugging tools in common development environments
such as:

-   [Eclipse IDE](eclipse "Getting started with Eclipse IDE")
-   [Maven](maven "Getting started with Maven")
-   [Maven and Spring](maven-spring "Getting Started with Maven and Spring")
-   [Debugging tools](debugging-tools "Debugging tools")

Finally, there is the [Restlet in Action](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193518234X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=193518234X&linkCode=as2&tag=restlet-20)
book written by Restlet creators and published by Manning that is a highly recommended reading for a smoother Restlet learning curve.
