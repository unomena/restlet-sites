CLAP (ClassLoader Access Protocol) is a custom scheme to access to
representations via classloaders (e.g.:
clap://thread/org/restlet/Restlet.class). This protocol accepts three
kinds of authority :

-   class: the resources will be resolved from the classloader
    associated with the local class.
-   system: the resources will be resolved from the system's
    classloader.
-   thread: the resources will be resolved from the current thread's
    classloader.
