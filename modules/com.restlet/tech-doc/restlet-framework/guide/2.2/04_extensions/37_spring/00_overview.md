# Introduction

This extension provides various modes of integration between the Restlet
Framework and the popular Spring Framework. Historically, this extension
emerged from the needs of Spring users, stuck between the Spring's
mechanism of Dependency Injection mostly based on JavaBean setters
(Setter Injection) and constructor arguments (Constructor Injection),
and the conceptual choices of the Restlet Framework that didn't
systematize the use of simple POJOs.Â
