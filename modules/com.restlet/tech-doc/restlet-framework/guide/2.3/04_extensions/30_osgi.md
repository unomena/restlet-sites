Support for highly dynamic web APIs.

This extension contains support for the OBAP (OSGi Bundle Access Protocol) pseudo-protocol. It includes a client connector that lets you access to resources from other OSGi bundles in a RESTful way. Just use this syntax:

    obap://{bundleSymbolicName}/{pathToResource}

For additional details, please consult the
[Javadocs](javadocs://osgi/ext/org/restlet/ext/osgi/package-summary.html).
