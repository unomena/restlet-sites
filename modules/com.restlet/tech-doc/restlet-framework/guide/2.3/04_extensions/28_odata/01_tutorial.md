# Introduction

REST can play a key role in order to facilitate the interoperability
between Java and Microsoft environments. To demonstrate this, the
Restlet team Restlet team worked with Microsoft in order to provide a
new Restlet extension that will provide several high level features for
accessing WCF Data Services.

## Figure 1 - The WCF Data Services Framework Architecture

Initially known as “Astoria” then ADO.NET Data Services, the WCF Data
Services technology has become the preferred way to RESTfully expose
data sources (relational databases, in-memory data, XML files, etc.) in
the .NET framework.

The “org.restlet.ext.odata” extension for the Restlet Framework provides
a client API to access remote WCF Data Services or other services
supporting the OData protocol. It allows access to the exposed entities,
to their properties and their associations (when an entity is linked to
other entities). We will illustrate this with a sample WCF Data Service
with the following root URI:
[http://restlet.cloudapp.net/TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/](http://restlet.cloudapp.net/TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/)

Note that the Azure service mentionned above isn't available anymore as
the account has expired. Sorry for the inconvenience.

This service defines two kinds of entities:

-   “Cafe”, and
-   “Item”.

A “Cafe” defines several properties such as “ID”, “Name”, “City”, and an
Item is simply defined by an “ID” and a “Description”. Cafe and Item are
linked, for intentional simplification, in a “one to one” association.
That is to say, a “Cafe” has one attribute called “Item”.

## Figure 2 - Class diagram of the TestAssociationOneToOne service

# Code generation

From the client perspective, if you want to handle the declared
entities, you will have to create a class for each entity, defines their
attributes, and pray that you have correctly spelled them and defined
their type. Thanks to the Restlet extension, a generation tool will make
your life easier. It will take care of this task for you, and generate
the whole set of Java classes with correct types.

## Figure 3 - Overview of code generation

Just note the URI of the target service, and specify the directory where
you would like to generate the code:

    java -jar org.restlet.ext.odata.jar http://restlet.cloudapp.net/TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/ ~/workspace/testADO

Please note that this feature requires the use of the core Restlet, and
additional dependencies such as Atom (used by OData services for all
exchanges of data), XML (required by the Atom extension) and FreeMarker
(used for the files generation). The following jars (take care of the
names) must be present on the current directory:

-   org.restlet.jar (core Restlet)
-   org.restlet.ext.odata.jar (OData extension)
-   org.restlet.ext.atom.jar (Atom extension)
-   org.restlet.ext.xml.jar (XML extension)
-   org.restlet.ext.freemarker.jar (Freemarker extension)
-   org.freemarker.jar (Freemarker dependency)

You can also used the full command line that includes the list of
required archives for the class path argument (nb: take care of the OS
specific classpath separator) and the name of the main class:

    java -cp org.restlet.jar:org.restlet.ext.xml.jar:org.restlet.ext.atom.jar:org.restlet.ext.freemarker.jar:org.restlet.ext.odata.jar:org.freemarker.jar org.restlet.ext.odata.Generator
     http://restlet.cloudapp.net/TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/
     ~/workspace/testADO

This will generate the following java classes and directory:

    testAssociationOneToOne/
      +-- Cafe.java
      +-- Item.java
    TestAssociationOneToOneQuery.java

The classes that correspond to entities are generated in their
corresponding package (in our case: “testAssociationOneToOne”), as
defined by the meta data of the target Data Service. The last class
(“TestAssociationOneToOneService”) is what we call a service object.
Such object is able to handle the communication with the data service,
and is able to store the state of the latest executed request and the
corresponding response. The communication between the client and the
server is still stateless.

Before using the generated classes, let’s explain how the Java code is
generated from the metadata of the target OData service. Actually, the
Generator class extracts a few elements of the metadata such as the
schema and the entities as follow.

WCF concept

Java concept

Entity

Class

Entity name

Class name

Enclosing schema namespace

Package name

Entity property

Member variable with getter and setter

EDM data type

Java primitive types and classes

## Transformation table from WCF concepts to Java equivalent concepts

Regarding the conversion of the data type, an equivalence table has been
established as follow:

EDM data type | Java data type
------------- | --------------
Binary | byte[]
Boolean | boolean
DateTime | java.util.Date
Decimal | long
Single | float
Double | double
Guid | java.lang.String
Int16 | short
Int32 | int
Int64 | long
Byte | byte
String | java.lang.String

## Data type conversion table

We have finished for now of the theoretical aspects; let's see how to
use the generated classes.

# Get the current set of Cafes and Items

The code below gets the whole set of Cafe entities and displays some of
their properties. It will display this kind of output on the console:

    id: 1
    name: Le Café Louis
    id: 2
    name: Le Petit Marly

    TestAssociationOneToOneService service = new TestAssociationOneToOneService();
    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes");

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
    }

## Retrieve the set of “Cafe” entities.

The first step is the creation of a new service. This is the only
required action, and it must be done once, but prior to any other one.
Then, as, we want to get a set of “Cafe”, we just create a new query and
specify the desired data. Under the hood, it actually makes a GET
request to the “/Cafes” resource (relatively to the service's URI), and
receive as a result a AtomXML feed document. This document is parsed by
the query which provides the result as an Iterator. Finally, we can loop
over the iterator and access to each “Cafe” instance.

Here is the content of the HTTP request:

    GET /TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/Cafes HTTP/1.1
    Host: restlet.cloudapp.net
    User-Agent: Noelios-Restlet/2.0snapshot
    Accept: */*
    Connection: close

And here is the response of the server including both response headers
and entity:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Content-Type: application/atom+xml;charset=utf-8

Getting the set of defined “Item” is quite similar:

    Query<Item> queryItem = service.createItemQuery("/Items");

    for (Item Item : queryItem) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Item.getID());
        System.out.println(“desc.: ” + Item.getDescription());
    }

## Retrieve the set of “Item” entities.

Please note that for the rest of the document, we assume the “service”
object has already been instantiated.

# Get a single Entity

Imagine we want to retrieve the first “Cafe” of the list, that is to
say, the one which identifier is equal to “1”. As for the set of
entities, you just have to create a new query, with a new parameter. The
code below should produce this output:

    id: 1  
    name: Le Café Louis

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes('1')");

    Cafe Cafe = query.iterator().next();
    System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
    System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());

## Retrieve the “Cafe” by its identifier.

As for a set of entities, you have to create a new query, and precise
the identifier of the target resource. WCF adopts its own naming
convention. You surely notice that the identifier is enclosed between
“(“ and “)” characters. \
 Now, you can ask the query to return the entity with a call to the
“next” method, and if the entity exists, you can print its properties.
An additional call to “next” will provide a “null” result.

# Add a new Entity

Let's complete the current list of entities and add a new one. This
process is quite simple and just requires you to firstly create and
complete the new entity, then invoke the “addEntity” method as follow.

    Cafe Cafe = new Cafe();
    Cafe.setID("3");
    Cafe.setZipCode(12345);
    Cafe.setName("Bar des sports");
    Cafe.setCity("Paris");

    service.addEntity(Cafe);

## Add a new Cafe

The generated subclass of Service contains a dedicated method for each
declared entities. In our case, there are two of them, one for the Cafe
class, and the other for the Item class. Such method actually sends a
POST request to the corresponding entity set resource. For example,
adding a new Café sends a POST request to the “/Cafes” resource. Here is
the sample content of such generated request:

    POST /TestAssociationOneToOne.svc/Cafes HTTP/1.1
    Host: restlet.cloudapp.net
    User-Agent: Noelios-Restlet/2.0snapshot
    Accept: */*
    Content-Type: application/atom+xml
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: close

    </entry>

Before using this feature, ensure that you provide a correctly
identified object, especially, don’t try to add an entity with a null
value. It appears that the remote service does not prevent such cases
which could lead to irremediably mess the content of the entity set.

# Update an Entity

Once you have retrieved an entity, imagine that you want to update one
of its properties. The sample code below illustrates this with the “Nom”
property. It simply uses the “updateEntity” method. You can check that
the value has really been taken into account by making a new query.

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes('1')");

    Cafe Cafe = query.iterator().next();
    Cafe.setNom("Bar des sports");

    service.updateEntity(Cafe);

## Update a Cafe

Under the hood, a PUT request is sent to the corresponding Web resource.

# Delete an Entity

Let's finish the tour of the basic operations with the deletion of an
entity. You just need to wall the deleteEntity method as shown just
below.

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes('1')");
    Cafe Cafe = query.iterator().next();

    service.deleteEntity(Cafe);

## Delete a Cafe.

Basically, this operation requires a valid Java Object instance
correctly identified: that is to say, the attribute that serves as
identifier must be correctly valuated.

# Get a single Entity and its associated entities

Until now, we looked at entities and their basic properties. However, we
pointed out at the beginning of this Item that a “Cafe” also aggregates
“Item” entities. You may have noticed, during your own tests, that the
Item property was always null. By default, associations are not
expanded, but they can be. If you run the following code, you will get
this kind of trace at the console.

    Cafe
    id: 1
    name: Le Café Louis
    Item
    id: 1
    Description: Poulet au curry

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes('1')").expand("Item");

    Cafe Cafe = query.next();
    System.out.println("Cafe");
    System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
    System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
    System.out.println("Item");
    System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getItem().getID());
    System.out.println(“Description: ” + Cafe.getItem().getDescription());

## Retrieve a “Cafe” by its identifier, with the associated Item in one request.

Instead of just creating a query as seen above, you can complete it by
calling the “expand” method. It takes one parameter which is the name of
the entity attribute you want to expand. Please note that you can also
invoke this when requesting the “/Cafes” entity set.

# Other kinds of queries

The expansion of query is one of the features provided by the OData
protocol. Other ones are available that aim at ordering, filtering, and
limiting the set of the results returned by a query. This section is an
exhaustive list of those available features.

## Order

Let's say you want to order a list of ItemItems by their “description”
attribute. For example, once applied to the set of all Items provided by
our sample OData service, the following code should display at the
console this king of trace:

    id: 2   
    description: Pâté
    id: 1
    description: Poulet au curry

    Query<Item> query = service.createItemQuery("/Items").orderby("Description");

    for (Item Item : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Item.getID());
        System.out.println(“description: ” + Item.getDescription());
    }

### Order a set of entities

Just as the “expand” method, it takes one parameter which is the name of
the property used to order the set of results.

## Filter

Do you want to filter the set of results? Using the “filter” method, you
will be able to specify one or more criteria that the entities returned
by the query must share. You will express these constraints using LINQ 
(Language-Integrated Query). LINQ has been originally designed to bridge
the gap between the world of data and the world of objects (in the
context of C\# and Visual Basic programs). In the context of OData
services, it helps filtering a set of data. Its syntax is very close to
SQL's one.

Let's illustrate its use by limiting the set of Cafe objects to the one
(there should be only one) having its ID equals to “1”. Applied to the
list of current Cafes, the following code will produce this display on
the console:

    id: 1  
    nom: Le Café Louis

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").filter("Name eq 'Le Café Louis'");

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“nom: ” + Cafe.getNom());
    }

### Filter a set of entities

## Skip

The “skip” method takes one parameter which is a number, and simply
allows you to omit the first elements of the set theoretically returned
by the query.

Let's say you want to omit the first “Cafe” of the list, just call the
“skip” method as shown in the sample code below. It should display this
kind of trace at the console.

    id: 2  
    name: Le Petit Marly

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").skip(1);

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
    }

### Skip the first entity

## Top

Just as the “skip” method, “top” takes a number parameter which
represents the maximum number of results that the query will return. Its
use is very simple as shown below:

    id: 1
    name: Le Café Louis

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").top(1);

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
    }

### Limit the number of returned entities.

The “skip” and “top” can be used together for paging a set of results.

# Support of projections

Projections allow you to retrieve a subset of the properties of queried
entities. It is a way to reduce the amount of data transfered from the
server. \
 You can restrict your query to set of properties, either simple or
complex or even navigation properties (links to other entities). The
OData protocol specifies the usage of the **\$select** query parameter
[here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee525214%28PROT.10%29.aspx).
\
 The result of such projection is a list of entities as usual, except
that these entities are only populated with the selected properties.\
 For example, the following code will only get the name of the Cafe
entities:

    id: null
    name: Le Café Louis

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").top(1).select("Name");

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
    }

## Limit the number of returned properties

This applies also to associated entities, as far as the association is
expanded:

    id: null
    name: Le Café Louis
    Item
    id: null
    Description: Poulet au curry

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").top(1).expand("Item").select("Name,Item.Description");

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“name: ” + Cafe.getName());
        System.out.println("Item");
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getItem().getID());
        System.out.println(“Description: ” + Cafe.getItem().getDescription());
    }

## Limit the number of returned properties

# Server-side paging

This mechanism also the server to limit the amount of data to transfer
in the response to a query made on an entity set. This is very
interesting if the set can contain a large set of entities.
Unfortunately, this feature has no impact on the way you use the Query
object of the OData extension. This is made transparent for the user.

# Get the row count

By invoking the **getCount** method on the Query object, you can
retrieve the number of entities contained by the target entity set.
having said that, you must be aware that there are two ways to get the
number of entities of an entity set (once filtering, if any, have been
applied). If the service supports the
[inlinecount](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd942040%28PROT.10%29.aspx)
feature, this count is obtained from the Feed document itself. This
allows to retrieve both count data and entries in the same request.
Another way is to send a dedicated request using the [\$count
segment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716656%28VS.100%29.aspx).
You can control this behaviour by invoking the **inlineCount** method on
the Query object. It accepts as a parameter a boolean value indicating
that you want to retrieve the count number using the *inlinecount* query
parameter (set the parameter to "true") or directly using the *\$count*
segment (set the parameter to "false", this is the value by default).
The following sample code illustrates how to get the count using the
*inlinecount* query parameter.

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").inlineCount(true);

    System.out.println("Number of entities: " + query.getCount());

## Get the number of Cafes

Please note that the *inlinecount* query parameter is not supported by
every service.

# Support of customizable feeds

[Customizable
feeds](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee373839%28VS.100%29.aspx)
is a server-side feature that address specific use-case that requires
that the Atom data feeds produced by the data service will use both
standard Atom elements or custom feed elements. This of course has an
impact on the way the Atom document must be parsed, but this has no
impact on the way you use the OData extension.

# Handling blobs (aka media link entries)

[Media link
entries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee473426.aspx)
are specific entities that allow to handle binary content such as
images, documents, etc. Each entity can be seen as collection of
metadata about the binary content, plus the binary content itself. Since
the metadata are stored as basic attribute members of the entity class
(as usual), there must be a specific way to handle the binary content.
At that point the Service class introduces a set of new methods to
handle the "value" of a blob entity:

-   getValueRef(Object) that returns the URI of the target binary
    content
-   getValue(Object) and getValue(Object, \*) methods that allow you to
    retrieve as a Representation the binary content of a given entity.

# Access to secured services

WCF Data Services can choose their security option. In order to access
those kinds of services, you must have been given the following
information:

-   login and password
-   security scheme such as HTTP BASIC, Windows Shared Key and Shared
    Key Lite, etc.

These data must be supplied to the service instance which takes care of
all communications with the target service. This is generally done once,
after the instantiation of the service. Here is an illustration of how
to set the credentials:

    service.setCredentials(
            new ChallengeResponse(ChallengeScheme.HTTP_BASIC,
                            "login",
                            "password")
            );

    Query<Cafe> query = service.createCafeQuery("/Cafes").top(1);

    for (Cafe Cafe : query) {
        System.out.println(“id: ” + Cafe.getID());
        System.out.println(“nname: ” + Cafe.getName());
    }

## Add credentials to access a secured service.

Note that Restlet framework supports a wide set of security schemes,
including HTTP BASIC, HTTP DIGEST, Windows Shared Key and Shared Key
Lite.

## Access to NTLM secured services

Please refer to [this
document](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/27-restlet/46-restlet/112-restlet/364-restlet.html "NTLM authentication")

# Support of capability negotiation based on protocol versions

As stated by the WCF documentation
([here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd541202%28PROT.10%29.aspx)),
client and server may talk different dialects of the OData protocol. The
Service class provides several methods that allow you to control these
aspects:

-   getClientVersion and setClientVersion to handle the supported
    version of OData protocol.
-   getMaxClientVersion and setMaxClientVersion to handle the max number
    version od supported version of the OData protocol
-   getServerVersion to get the version of the dialect talked by the
    server.

The values setted by setClientVersion and setMaxClientVersion are not
controlled by the framework, but they must follow a format specified
[here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd541109%28PROT.10%29.aspx).

# Conclusion

This article illustrates what can be done with the Restlet extension for
OData services. We hope that you found it simple and useful to follow to
read. It is a good demonstration of how adopting of REST and related
standards such as HTTP and Atom facilitates the interoperability across
programming languages and executions environments.
