This extension provides several tools that can we used either in standalone mode within Restlet Framework or integrated with the [APISpark](https://apispark.com/) PaaS for web API for extended features.

Here are the main two features provided:
* [Introspector](technical-resources/restlet-framework/guide/2.3/extensions/apispark/introspector), a tool to extract the web API definition of your Restlet API or JAX-RS API based application and push it to APISpark to provide documentation and tooling.

* [Firewall](technical-resources/restlet-framework/guide/2.3/extensions/apispark/firewall), a service that adds rate limitation to your web API.
