# Introduction

It is possible to declare client connectors when the application is
hosted on a Servlet container. The Javadocs of the Servlet adapter
([ServerServlet](javadocs://jee/ext/org/restlet/ext/servlet/ServerServlet.html)
class) answers this question and others related to the configuration of
Restlet based applications.

The web.xml file declares the client connectors in a dedicated
"org.restlet.clients" parameter:

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>RestletAdapter</servlet-name>
        [...]
        <!-- List of supported client protocols (Optional - Only in mode 3) -->
        <init-param>
            <param-name>org.restlet.clients</param-name>
            <param-value>HTTP HTTPS FILE</param-value>
        </init-param>
        [...]
    </servlet>
