## Framework overview

Restlet is a comprehensive yet lightweight RESTful web API framework for
Java that lets you embrace the architecture style of the Web (REST) and
benefit from its simplicity and scalability. By using our
innovative framework, you can start blending your web services, web
sites and web clients into uniform web applications!

Restlet has a light core but thanks to its pluggable extension, it is
also a comprehensive REST framework for Java. It supports all REST
concepts (Resource, Representation, Connector, Component, etc.) and is
suitable for both client and server Web applications.

It supports major Web standards like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON, OData, OAuth,
RDF, RSS, WADL, and Atom.

Many extensions are also available to integrate
with Servlet, Spring, Jetty, Simple, JAXB, JAX-RS, JiBX, Velocity,
FreeMarker, XStream, Jackson, SLF4J, SDC and many more!

Special editions for Android, GWT, GAE, Java SE, Java EE and OSGi are also
available and kept synchronized with an automated porting process.
