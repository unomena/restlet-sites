   <h3>Restlet 1.1 - Benchmark</h3>

   <h4>Introduction</h4>

   <p>
      This section describes some performance tests involving the various
      standalone HTTP server connectors distributed with Restlet Engine.
      For comparison purpose, we also tested the Servlet adapter with popular 
      Servlet containers. The tests have been made with the release 1.1.3 of the 
      Restlet.
   </p>

   <p>
      This benchmark doesn't aim to provide an absolute comparison between the
      various connectors and the servlet containers tested for at least one reason:
      only their default configuration was used, with no particular optimization
      or performance tuning except for the connector based on Jetty. We would 
      like to show the behavior of the Restlet framework in different situations 
      where the server load varies from light to heavy, and prove that the various 
      connectors are scalable and usable in production environments.
   </p>

   <h4>Environment</h4>

   <div>
      The tests have been made on a laptop with the following characteristics:<br/>
      Hardware Environment
      <ul>
         <li>Processor : Pentium M Centrino 1.8 Ghz</li>
         <li>RAM : 1.5 GB</li>
      </ul>
      Software environment
      <ul>
         <li>OS : Linux Xubuntu 8.04 (Hardy)</li>
         <li>JRE Version : 1.5.0_16</li>
         <li>Java VM : Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM</li>
      </ul>
      Note that the usage of the JVM in the HotSpot server mode is generally
      recommended for Restlet deployments as it tend to slightly improve the performance.

   <h4>Specifications</h4>

   <h5>Stress tool</h5>

   <p>
      The following tests have been made with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a> delivered by Apache HTTP Server 2.0.
      Ab especially shows how many requests per second the web server is capable
      of serving. For this benchmark, one file is served: a single text file
      (2.1 kb). The number of concurrent requests varied from 1 to 200 for one serie of tests, 
      and the number of requests (with only one client) varied from 1 to 500 for the other.
   </p>

   <p>
      Apache Bench command line:
   </p>

   <pre>
ab -q -c %concurrency% -n 1000 %url_test%
   </pre>

   <p>
      where %concurrency% varied from 1 to 200.
   </p>

   <pre>
ab -q -c 1 -n %nbRequests% %url_test%
   </pre>

   <p>
      where %nbRequests% varied from 1 to 500.
   </p>

   <h5>Restlet connectors configuration</h5>

   <p>
      The Restlet connectors have been tested with their default configuration 
      except for the connector based on Jetty. The maximum number of threads 
      has been increased to 1000 ("maxThread" parameter).
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Please refer to the <a href="connectors">connectors page</a> for more
      details about the available parameters for each tested connectors.
   </p>

   <p>
      The application using the Restlet connectors has been launched via the
      <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org">Tanuki wrapper</a>, that
      provides several nice services especially "write once run everywhere"
      service. It manages a dedicated JVM instance where your application is 
      running. For these tests, the JVM has been configured with the following 
      parameters:
   </p>

   <pre>
-server
-Djava.awt.headless=true
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=%PROD_HOME%/data/config/logging.properties
   </pre>

   <h5>Servlet containers configuration</h5>

   <p>
      As written in the introduction, both tested Servlet containers Apache 
      Tomcat and Jetty haven't been especially configured for this benchmark. 
      They were just installed, and then ready to use.
   </p>

   </table>

   <p>
      In this series of tests, an increasing number of concurrent clients that 
      ranges from 1 to 200 are asked to send 1000 requests. This test tends to 
      illustrate the scalability of the server connector. What can explain the 
      upper limit of 1000 requests by second? At first sight, it could be the 
      number of threads (1000 for Jetty), but actually the pool of threads of 
      the internal and the Grizzly connectors are not limited at all. The main 
      reason must be that there is only 1000 requests to achieve.
   </p>

   <p>
      We notice that the average time per request increases linearly with the 
      number of concurrent clients varies, although the response rate seems 
      more or less constant.
   </p>

   <p>
      Except for the connector based on Simple 3, the connnectors seem to
      perform homogenously, regarding the number of requests handled per 
      second. Unsurprisingly, the response time is increasing with the number 
      of concurrent requests.
   </p>
   
   <h3 style="margin-top: 30px">Second series of tests: variation of the number of requests</h5>

   <table>
      <tr>
         <td style="text-align: center" colspan="2">Click on the image to enlarge it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><a href="images/clients-reqBySec-txt"><img src="images/clients-reqBySec-txt-thumb" alt="benchmark results - number of clients - requests per second" /></a></td>
         <td><a href="images/clients-reqTime-txt"><img src="images/clients-reqTime-txt-thumb" alt="benchmark results - number of clients - time per request"/></a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

         <td><a href="images/clients-reqTime-servlet-txt"><img src="images/clients-reqTime-servlet-txt-thumb" alt="benchmark results - number of clients - servlet containers - time per request"/></a></td>
      </tr>
   </table>

   <p>
      In this series of tests, a single client is asked to launch a number of 
      requests that ranges from 1 to 500. This test tends to illustrate how 
      the connector performs when there is no processing overload on the server
      since the content is not generated but only delivered.
   </p>

   <p>
      When the number of requests varies, we notice that the time spent per 
      request is more or less constant and does not exceed 20 ms. At the same 
      time, the response rate degrades quite regularly which seems to denote 
      an increasing latency.
   </p>

   <p>
      The graphs seem to establish a hierarchy between the connector based on 
      Simple 3 and the others. We can notice than the former has not been 
      updated since May 2006 (since the team is focused on Simple 4, that we 
      will support in Restlet 2.0), whereas the ones based on Grizzly and Jetty 
      are pretty recent (March 2009). We can also notice that the performance 
      of all connectors looks generally good.
   </p>

   <h4>Conclusion</h4>

   <p>
      These simple tests show that under normal conditions, each connector 
      responds quickly and correctly. The response time are correct and each of 
      them seems reasonably scalable.
