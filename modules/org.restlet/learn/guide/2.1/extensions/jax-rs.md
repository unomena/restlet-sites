JAX-RS extension
================

Introduction
============

This Restlet Extension implements the Java Specification [JAX-RS: Java
API for RESTful Web
Services](https://jsr311.dev.java.net/).
Note that this implementation is not final yet.

Description
===========

To run this example, you need the Restlet libraries. Download a 2.1
version from
[restlet.org/downloads/](http://restlet.org/downloads/).
(For a general Restlet example take a look at [the first steps
examples](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/21-restlet/318-restlet.html "First steps")).

Now create a new Java Project, and add the following jars (resp.
projects) to the classpath (right click on project, Properties, Java
Build Path, Libraries (resp.Projects), Add):

-   org.restlet (the core Restlet API)
-   org.restlet.ext.jaxrs (the JAX-RS Runtime)
-   javax.ws.rs (the JAX-RS API and also the specification)

Depending of your needs you have to add the following:

-   if you want to use the provider for javax.xml.transform.DataSource:
    add javax.activation and javax.mail
-   if you want to use the provider for JAXB: add javax.xml.bind and
    javax.xml.stream
-   if you want to use the provider for JSON: add org.json

Click "Ok" twice. Now you are ready to start. - First we will create an
example root resource class and then show how to get it running by the
Restlet JAX-RS extension.

For additional details, please consult the
[Javadocs](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.1/jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/jaxrs/package-summary.html).

Create JAX-RS example
=====================

Create a new package, e.g. test.restlet.jaxrs

Create a root resource class
----------------------------

First create an easy root resource class: Create a new java class named
**EasyRootResource** in the previously created package and insert the
following source  code:

    package test.restlet.jaxrs;

    import javax.ws.rs.GET;
    import javax.ws.rs.Path;
    import javax.ws.rs.Produces;

    @Path("easy")
    public class EasyRootResource {

        @GET
        @Produces("text/html")
        public String getHtml() {
            return "<html><head></head><body>\n"
                    + "This is an easy resource (as html text).\n"
                    + "</body></html>";
        }

        @GET
        @Produces("text/plain")
        public String getPlain() {
            return "This is an easy resource (as plain text)";
        }
    }

Create Application
------------------

To provide a collection of root resource classes (and others) for a
JAX-RS runtime you integrate these classes to an Application. Create a
new class **ExampleApplication** in the same package with the following
content:

    package test.restlet.jaxrs;

    import java.util.HashSet;
    import java.util.Set;
    import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

    public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

        public Set<Class<?>> getClasses() {
            Set<Class<?>> rrcs = new HashSet<Class<?>>();
            rrcs.add(EasyRootResource.class);
            return rrcs;
        }
    }

The root resource class and the Application is specified by the JAX-RS
specification. It can be used in any JAX-RS runtime environment.

Now create a runtime environment instance and pass the Application
instance to it. This is runtime environment specfic. Below you see this
for the Restlet JAX-RS environment:

Set up a JAX-RS server
======================

A JAX-RS server using the Restlet JAX-RS extension is set up like any
Restlet server. Create a third class in the same package, named
**ExampleServer**:

    package test.restlet.jaxrs;

    import org.restlet.Component;
    import org.restlet.Server;
    import org.restlet.data.Protocol;
    import org.restlet.ext.jaxrs.JaxRsApplication;

    public class ExampleServer {

        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            // create Component (as ever for Restlet)
            Component comp = new Component();
            Server server = comp.getServers().add(Protocol.HTTP, 8182);

            // create JAX-RS runtime environment
            JaxRsApplication application = new JaxRsApplication(comp.getContext());

            // attach Application
            application.add(new ExampleApplication());

            // Attach the application to the component and start it
            comp.getDefaultHost().attach(application);
            comp.start();

            System.out.println("Server started on port " + server.getPort());
            System.out.println("Press key to stop server");
            System.in.read();
            System.out.println("Stopping server");
            comp.stop();
            System.out.println("Server stopped");
        }
    }

Start this class, open a browser and request
[http://localhost:8182/easy](http://localhost:8182/easy).
Now you see the HTML representation. If you request the same URI with
accepted media type "text/plain", you get a plain text representation.

This example (a little bit extended) is available in the project
org.restlet.example. See package org.restlet.test.jaxrs. There is
another root resource class with a reacheable resource class and also an
example with user authentication.

A lot of more resource classes are available in the test project
(org.restlet.test, packages starting with org.restlet.test.jaxrs). They
are implemented for testing, and most of them do not do intelligent
things ... :-) But they show the actual status of development of this
JAX-RS runtime environment.

This runtime environment is still under development, and I'm very busy
continuing it ...

Run in a Servlet Container
--------------------------

If you want to run the JAX-RS Application in a Servlet Container, create
a subclass of the JaxRsApplication. In the constructor you could attach
the Application and sets the Guard and the RoleChecker (if needed).

    public class MyJaxRsApplication extends JaxRsApplication {

        public MyJaxRsApplication(Context context) {
            super(context);
            this.add(new ExampleApplication());
            this.setGuard(...); // if needed
            this.setRoleChecker(...); // if needed
        }
    }

For details to run this Application in a Servet Container take a look at
[Restlet
FAQ](/learn/guide/2.1#/13-restlet/24-restlet/333-restlet.html "FAQ").

You could use this subclass also in the example above:

            // create JAX-RS runtime environment
            Application application = new MyJaxRsApplication(comp.getContext());
      
            // if you use this kind, you don't need to attach the Application again.
