SIP extension
=============

Introduction
============

This extension provides support for the Session Initiation Protocol,
largely used for voice over IP (VoIP). It ships both client and server
SIP connectors over TCP, reusing the 90% of the logic used by the new
NIO/HTTP internal connector, providing excellent scalability and
performance.

For now, you can get more details on the [Restlet/SIP specifications
page](/participate#/257-restlet/300-restlet.html).

Features
========

-   SIP transport over TCP
-   All SIP headers, including "Via", map to a Java API
-   All base SIP methods supported
-   Extension INFO, REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH and REFER
    methods supported
-   OPTIONS method supported : useful for integration purposes as most
    gateways require it for redundancy

Mapping SIP headers

headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters)
