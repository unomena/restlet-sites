First application
=================

Introduction
============

This first application illustrates how to develop a Restlet application
that combines several editions of the Restlet Framework : GAE, GWT,
Android and Java SE. It explains the benefits of annotated Restlet
interfaces and of the ConverterService that offers transparent
serialization between Restlet representations and Java objects, usable
between a server application and several kind of clients.

Requirements
============

It is based on the following editions of the Restlet Framework : Java SE
(JSE), Google App Engine (GAE), Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and Android
which must be downloaded separately from [this
page](http://restlet.org/downloads/).
It has been tested with the following environments:

-   Restlet Framework 2.0
-   Google App Engine (GAE) 1.2.1 to 1.4.2
-   Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 1.7 to 2.1 (probably previous versions as
    well)
-   Android 1.6 to 2.1 (probably previous versions as well)

GAE doesn't support HTTP chunked encoding, therefore serialized object
can't be sent (via POST or PUT) to a GAE server. In Restlet Framework
version 2.1 M4 we have a workaround available that buffers the HTTP
entity to prevent chunk encoding. This issue is tracked
[here](http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1219),
including a workaround for 2.0 if you can upgrade to 2.1 just yet. Note
that this workaround isn't required for the GWT edition.

Scenario
========

The server application is hosted on the Google App Engine (GAE)
platform. For the sake of simplicity it serves only one resource named
"contact", with the following characteristics:

-   its relative URI is "/contacts/123"
-   it supports the GET, PUT and DELETE methods.
-   it represents a simple "contact" object.

The "contact" object has the following attributes:

-   firstname
-   lastname
-   age
-   home address (actually an instance of a "Address" class): line1,
    line2, zipcode, city and country

 This resource will be requested fro several kind of clients:

-   GWT client page
-   Android application
-   Java SE client

Archive content
===============

The full source code (without the required archives) is available here:
[serializationFullSource.](/learn/guide/2.0#/304-restlet/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/serializationFullSource.zip "serializationFullSource")
(application/zip, 1.4 MB,
[info](/learn/guide/2.0#/304-restlet.html))

It contains the full source code of three Eclipse projects with:

1.  Project that contains both the GAE server and the GWT client code
2.  Project that contains the source code of the Android client
3.  Project that contains the source code of the Java SE client

Common classes
==============

The following classes are available on the three project. They are used
by the server and the clients in order to produce the serialized
representation of the Contact object and to deserialize incoming
representations.

-   Contact
-   Address
-   ContactResource.

ContactResource is an interface annotated with Restlet annotations:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
public interface ContactResource {
    @Get
    public Contact retrieve();

    @Put
    public void store(Contact contact);

    @Delete
    public void remove();
}
~~~~

It represents the contract passed between the client and the server.

When using collections of objects as method parameters, you need to use
concrete classes if you intend to have GWT clients. For example use
ArrayList\<Contact\> instead of List\<Contact\>.

GAE server part
===============

We propose to host the server application on the GAE platform. The
server project relies on the following JAR files:

-   org.restlet.jar: core archive (*GAE edition*)
-   org.restlet.ext.gwt.jar: GWT server-side extension to convert Java
    objects to a GWT-specific serialization format (*GAE edition*)
-   org.restlet.ext.servlet.jar: Servlet extension to deploy the Restlet
    application in GAE (*GAE edition*)
-   org.restlet.ext.jackson.jar: Jackson extension used to generate JSON
    representations of the contact resource (*GAE edition*)
-   org.codehaus.jackson.core.jar, org.codehaus.jackson.mapper.jar:
    archives of the Jackson libraries required by the Jackson extension,
    and available in the GAE edition.

The server-side resource implements the annotated interface.

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
/**
 * The server side implementation of the Restlet resource.
 */
public class ContactServerResource extends ServerResource implements ContactResource {

   private static volatile Contact contact = 
        new Contact("Scott", "Tiger", new Address("10 bd Google", null, "20010", "Mountain View", 
                    "USA"), 40);

    public void remove() {
        contact = null;
    }

    public Contact retrieve() {
        return contact;
    }

    public void store(Contact contact) {
        ContactServerResource.contact = contact;
    }
}
~~~~

This resource is then exposed by the server application:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
    @Override
    public Restlet createInboundRoot() {
        Router router = new Router(getContext());

        router.attachDefault(new Directory(getContext(), "war:///"));
        router.attach("/contacts/123", ContactServerResource.class);

        return router;
    }
~~~~

GWT client part
===============

The GWT client relies only on the core Restlet JAR (org.restlet.jar)
provided in the GWT edition.

In order to get the Contact object, a proxy class is required. This is
an interface that inherits on a specific interface (delivered by the GWT
edition of the Restlet Framework):

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
public interface ContactResourceProxy extends ClientProxy {
    @Get
    public void retrieve(Result<Contact> callback);

   @Put
    public void store(Contact contact, Result<Void> callback);

    @Delete
    public void remove(Result<Void> callback);
}
~~~~

This interface looks like the ContactResource interface, expect that it
adds a callback to each declared methods, due to the asynchronous nature
of the GWT platform and the underlying AJAX mechanism offered by web
browsers.

The type of the callback is not limited to the Result interface of the
Restlet Framework, it can also be the usual AsyncCallback interface
provided by GWT. Thus it allows you to easily migrate an existing
GWT-RPC code base to GWT-REST with Restlet.

Then, the following code allows you to request and handle the Contact
resource:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
ContactResourceProxy contactResource = GWT.create(ContactResourceProxy.class);

// Set up the contact resource
contactResource.getClientResource().setReference("/contacts/123");

// Retrieve the contact
contactResource.retrieve(new Result<Contact>() {
    public void onFailure(Throwable caught) {
        // Handle the error
    }

    public void onSuccess(Contact contact) {
        // Handle the contact, for example by updating the GWT interface
        // Contact fields
        cTbFirstName.setText(contact.getFirstName());
        cTbLastName.setText(contact.getLastName());
        cTbAge.setText(Integer.toString(contact.getAge()));
    }
});
~~~~

Here is a screenshot of the GWT client page once the user has clicked on
the GET button.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to update the contact, simply complete your contact object and
invoke the "store" method as specified by the proxy interface:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
contactResource.store(contact, new Result<Void>() {
    public void onFailure(Throwable caught) {
        // Handle the error
    }

    public void onSuccess(Void v) {
        // Display a dialog box
        dialogBox.setText("Update contact");
        textToServerLabel.setText("Contact successfully updated");
        dialogBox.center();
        closeButton.setFocus(true);
    }
});
~~~~

Android client part
===================

The Android client project relies only on the core Restlet JAR
(org.restlet.jar) provided by the Android edition of the Restlet
Framework.

The contact object will be serialized between the GAE server and the
Android client (in both directions) using the standard Java
serialization process. No additional interface is required except the
ContactResource interface furnished by the server.

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
// Initialize the resource proxy.
ClientResource cr = new ClientResource("http://restlet-example-serialization.appspot.com/contacts/123");
ContactResource resource = cr.wrap(ContactResource.class);

// Get the remote contact
Contact contact = resource.retrieve();
~~~~

In order to update the client, simply use this instruction:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
resource.store(contact);
~~~~

Here is a screenshot of the Android user interface.

Java SE client
==============

Get the full Contact object
---------------------------

The same code used on the Android application allows you to get the full
Contact object:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
ClientResource cr = new ClientResource("http://restlet-example-serialization.appspot.com/contacts/123");
// Get the Contact object
ContactResource resource = cr.wrap(ContactResource.class);
Contact contact = resource.retrieve();

if (contact != null) {
    System.out.println("firstname: " + contact.getFirstName());
    System.out.println(" lastname: " + contact.getLastName());
    System.out.println("     nage: " + contact.getAge());
}
~~~~

  This code produces the following ouput on the console:

    firstname: Scott
     lastname: Tiger
          age: 40

Get a JSON representation
-------------------------

In case the Contact class is not available, you can still retrieve a
JSON representation by setting the client preferences when retrieving
the resource's representation:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
cr.get(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).write(System.out);
~~~~

which produces the following output:

    {"age":40,"firstName":"Scott","homeAddress":{"country":"USA","city":"Mountain View","line1":"10 bd Google","line2":null,"zipCode":"20010"},
    "lastName":"Tiger"}
