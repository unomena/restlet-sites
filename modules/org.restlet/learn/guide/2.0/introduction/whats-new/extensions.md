Extensions
==========

Crypto extension
================

New extension that contains support for Amazon S3 and Windows Azure
client HTTP authentication (Shared Key and Shared Key Lite) schemes.

The support for HTTP DIGEST has been vastly improved, especially on the
client-side, with proper mapping of its properties to AuthenticationInfo
(new), ChallengeMessage (new), ChallengeRequest and ChallengeResponse
classes.

FreeMarker extension
====================

FreeMarker templates can now be loaded via the Context’s client
dispatcher and relatively to a base URI.

GWT extension (server-side)
===========================

Added an ObjectRepresentation class to the GWT edition and to the
"org.restlet.ext.gwt" server extension. This allows transparent
serialization of Java objects leveraging GWT-RPC serialization
mechanism, but using your REST APIs.

HTTP Client extension (Apache)
==============================

The extension has been updated from 3.1 to 4.0 version. Note that some
parameters have been changed, so be sure to verify your configuration.
In addition, it is now possible to specify a different proxy server to
use for each Restlet connector.

JAAS extension
==============

Following the security API enhancements and refactorings, the classes
relying on the javax.security.auth package have been moved to a new JAAS
extension**.**

Jackson extension
=================

New
[Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/)
extension added, offering a nice alternative to the existing XStream
extension for JSON object serialization (based on Jettison).

JAX-RS extension
================

Now leverages the new Security API

Jetty extension
===============

Updated to leverage the recent Jetty 7.0 version now hosted at Eclipse.

Lucene extension
================

In addition, a [Lucene
extension](/participate#/172-restlet/215-restlet.html)has
been created to host the Solr client connector contributed by Rémi
Dewitte who will lead this extension. There is also a TikaRepresentation
available to leverage Lucene Tika subproject when extracting metadata
from representations.

Net extension
=============

A new FTP client connector was added in the “org.restlet.ext.net”
extension, based on the JDK’s URLConnection class. It is limited and
only support GET methods.

Netty extension
===============

New extension leveraging the new NIO framework from JBoss. Provides HTTP
and HTTPS server connectors.

OData extension
===============

A new extension for [Microsoft ADO.NET Data
Services](http://blog.noelios.com/2009/09/28/restlet-bridges-ado-net-data-services-and-java/)
technology (previously known as “project Astoria”) was added, later
renamed to WCF Data Services then OData.

It provides a high-level client API based on the ClientResource class
that lets you access remote OData services, typically hosted in an
ASP.NET servers or on the Windows Azure cloud computing platform. The
extension contains both a code generator for the representation beans
and a runtime layer.

Advanced features such as projections, blobs, server-side paging, row
counts, customizable feeds or version headers are supported.

This extension is in the "org.restlet.ext.odata" package and depends on
"org.restlet.ext.atom" and "org.restlet.ext.xml" extensions. The
extension is also available on the Android edition of the Restlet
Framework.

RDF extension
=============

As announced when we presented the roadmap, we want to make Restlet a
great framework for building applications for the Semantic Web. The
relationship between REST and RDF is perfect and builds around the
concept of resources and their representations (REST) and the expression
of meaningful links between those resources (RDF).

We have written a [detailed
specification](/participate#/172-restlet/160-restlet.html?branch=docs-1_1&language=en)
and gathered feed-back from the community and especially [Henry
Story](http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/),
an expert in this area.

In Restlet 2.0, we have added Literal, Link,  LinkReference, LinkSet and
RdfRepresentation classes. That makes it easy to build a RDF graph, like
you would use a DOM API to build and XML document..

![](Extensions-63_files/semantic-web1.png)

This extension contains a full RDF API, leveraging the Restlet API, and
capable of processing RDF documents either in a DOM-like way or in a
SAX-like way. It is also capable of writing large RDF documents is a
SAX-like way. We currently support two serialization formats: RDF/XML,
RDF/n3, Turtle and N-Triples. In the next version we will extend those
formats to Turtle and NTriples.

A RdfClientResource class facilitates the navigation in the Web of Data.

ROME extension
==============

A new ROME extension was added to support several versions of RSS and
Atom syndication feeds formats. This extension is complementary with the
existing Atom extension which is fully based on Restlet API.

Servlet extension
=================

Improved to support multiple declarations of the ServerServlet in the
same Servlet application.

SLF4J extension
===============

The Restlet logging, based on JULI (java.util.logging), now has an
extension mechanism allowing an efficient redirection to alternate
mechanisms like log4j as [explained in the
wiki](/learn/guide/2.0#/13-restlet/48-restlet/101-restlet.html).
A new SLF4J extension has been added to facilitate the replacement of
Restlet’s default logger facade.

Spring extension
================

Updated to leverage Spring Framework version 3.0.

XML extension
=============

New "org.restlet.ext.xml" extension including XML related classes
previously in the core Restlet API. This ensures that the core Restlet
API stays as consistent as possible across all editions. In this case,
those features weren’t available in Android.

XStream extension
=================

Added an "org.restlet.ext.xstream" extension providing transparent
serialization between Java objects and XML or JSON.
