Restlet edition for Google App Engine
=====================================

Introduction
============

Google provides a Java version of his App Engine solution (GAE). It is a
PaaS (Platform as a Service) solution that offers massive and flexible
scalability for your Web applications by hosting them on the Google
cloud (based on Google computing infrastructure). For more details, you
can read [our blog
post](http://blog.noelios.com/2009/04/11/restlet-in-the-cloud-with-google-app-engine/)
with the official announce.

Due to the restrictions of the GAE, we need to provide an adaptation of
Restlet for this environment. GAE is based on Java 6, with a restricted
list of APIs. See [GAE developers
documentation](http://code.google.com/intl/fr/appengine/docs/java/overview.html)
for details.

Modules availables:

-   Restlet core (API + Engine)
-   Restlet extension - Javamail (SMTP client)
-   Restlet extension - Net (HTTP and HTTPS client)
-   Restlet extension - Servlet (HTTP and HTTPS server)
-   Restlet extension - XML (DOM, SAX and XPath)

Usage example
=============

Create a new GAE project with the Eclipse plugin provided, add the
"org.restlet.jar" and the "org.restlet.ext.servlet.jar" files from the
[latest Restlet 2.0
snapshots](http://restlet.org/downloads/unstable)(make
sure you download the edition for GAE) to your "/war/WEB-INF/lib/"
directory and to your project build path.

Here is the Restlet resource to create:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
package firstSteps;

import org.restlet.resource.Get;
import org.restlet.resource.ServerResource;

/**
 * Resource which has only one representation.
 * 
 */
public class HelloWorldResource extends ServerResource {

    @Get
    public String represent() {
        return "hello, world (from the cloud!)";
    }

}
~~~~

Now here is the parent application:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
package firstSteps;

import org.restlet.Application;
import org.restlet.Restlet;
import org.restlet.routing.Router;

public class FirstStepsApplication extends Application {

    /**
     * Creates a root Restlet that will receive all incoming calls.
     */
    @Override
    public Restlet createInboundRoot() {
        // Create a router Restlet that routes each call to a
        // new instance of HelloWorldResource.
        Router router = new Router(getContext());

        // Defines only one route
        router.attachDefault(HelloWorldResource.class);

        return router;
    }
}
~~~~

Finally, here is the Servlet configuration file:

~~~~ {.brush: .java}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
 "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
 "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">

<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="2.5">
         <display-name>first steps servlet</display-name>

         <servlet>
                 <servlet-name>RestletServlet</servlet-name>
                 <servlet-class>org.restlet.ext.servlet.ServerServlet</servlet-class>
                 <init-param>
                         <param-name>org.restlet.application</param-name>
                         <param-value>firstSteps.FirstStepsApplication  </param-value>
                 </init-param>
         </servlet>

    <!-- Catch all requests -->
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>RestletServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
