Application
===========

Restlet that can be attached to one or more VirtualHosts. Applications
are guaranteed to receive calls with their base reference set relatively
to the VirtualHost that served them. This class is both a descriptor
able to create the root Restlet and the actual Restlet that can be
attached to one or more VirtualHost instances.

Authenticator
=============

Filter authenticating the client sending the request based on mechanisms
such as challenge request and response or SSL certificates.

Authorizer
==========

Filter authorizing requests based on flexible criterias such as method
name, client role.

Client
======

Connector acting as a generic client. It internally uses one of the
available connectors registered with the current Restlet implementation.

Component
=========

Restlet managing a set of Clients, Servers and other Restlets. \
 "A component is an abstract unit of software instructions and internal
state that provides a transformation of data via its interface." Roy T.
Fielding

Component managing a set of VirtualHosts and Applications. Applications
are expected to be directly attached to VirtualHosts. Components are
also exposing a number of services in order to control several
operational features in a portable way, like access log and status
setting.

Connector
=========

Restlet enabling communication between Components. \
 "A connector is an abstract mechanism that mediates communication,
coordination, or cooperation among components. Connectors enable
communication between components by transferring data elements from one
interface to another without changing the data." Roy T. Fielding

"Encapsulate the activities of accessing resources and transferring
resource representations. The connectors present an abstract interface
for component communication, enhancing simplicity by providing a clean
separation of concerns and hiding the underlying implementation of
resources and communication mechanisms." Roy T. Fielding

Context
=======

Contextual data and services provided to a Restlet. The context is the
means by which a Restlet may access the software environment within the
framework. It is typically provided by the immediate parent Restlet
(Component and Application are the most common cases). The services
provided are access to a logger, access to configuration parameters and
to a request dispatcher.

Directory
=========

Handler mapping a directory of local resources. Those resources have
representations accessed by the file system, the WAR context or the
class loaders. An automatic content negotiation mechanism (similar to
the one in Apache HTTP server) is used to select the best representation
of a resource based on the available variants and on the client
capabilities and preferences.

Engine
======

A Restlet Engine is an implementation of the Restlet API. The reference
implementation, provided by Noelios Technologies, is therefore called
the Noelios Restlet Engine (NRE).

Filter
======

Restlet filtering calls before passing them to an attached Restlet. The
purpose is to do some pre-processing or post-processing on the calls
going through it before or after they are actually handled by an
attached Restlet. Also note that you can attach and detach targets while
handling incoming calls as the filter is ensured to be thread-safe.

Finder
======

Restlet that can find the target resource that will concretely handle
the request. Based on a given resource class, it is also able to
instantiate the resource with the call's context, request and response
without requiring the usage of a subclass. Once the target resource has
been found, the call is automatically dispatched to the appropriate
handle\*() method (where the '\*' character corresponds to the method
name) if the corresponding allow\*() method returns true.

For example, if you want to support a MOVE method for a WebDAV server,
you just have to add a handleMove() method in your subclass of Resource
and it will be automatically be used by the Finder instance at runtime.

If no matching handle\*() method is found, then a
Status.CLIENT\_ERROR\_METHOD\_NOT\_ALLOWED is returned.

Redirector
==========

Rewrites URIs then redirects the call or the client to a new
destination.

Representation
==============

Current or intended state of a resource. For performance purpose, it is
essential that a minimal overhead occurs upon initialization. The main
overhead must only occur during invocation of content processing methods
(write, getStream, getChannel and toString).Current or intended state of
a resource.

"REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation
to capture the current or intended state of that resource and
transferring that representation between components. A representation is
a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those
bytes. Other commonly used but less precise names for a representation
include: document, file, and HTTP message entity, instance, or variant."
Roy T. Fielding

Request
=======

Generic request sent by client connectors. It is then received by server
connectors and processed by Restlets. This request can also be processed
by a chain of Restlets, on the client or server sides. Requests are
uniform across all types of connectors, protocols and components.

Resource
========

Intended conceptual target of a hypertext reference. "Any information
that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal
service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other
resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other
words, any concept that might be the target of an author's hypertext
reference must fit within the definition of a resource."

"The only thing that is required to be static for a resource is the
semantics of the mapping, since the semantics is what distinguishes one
resource from another." Roy T. Fielding

Another definition adapted from the URI standard (RFC 3986): a resource
is the conceptual mapping to a representation (also known as entity) or
set of representations, not necessarily the representation which
corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time. Thus, a
resource can remain constant even when its content (the representations
to which it currently corresponds) changes over time, provided that the
conceptual mapping is not changed in the process. In addition, a
resource is always identified by a URI.

Response
========

Generic response sent by server connectors. It is then received by
client connectors. Responses are uniform across all types of connectors,
protocols and components.

Restlet
=======

Dispatcher that provides a context and life cycle support.

Route
=====

Filter scoring the affinity of calls with the attached Restlet. The
score is used by an associated Router in order to determine the most
appropriate Restlet for a given call.

Router
======

Restlet routing calls to one of the attached routes. Each route can
compute an affinity score for each call depending on various criteria.
The attach() method allow the creation of routes based on URI patterns
matching the beginning of a the resource reference's remaining part.

In addition, several routing modes are supported, implementing various
algorithms:

-   Best match (default)
-   First match
-   Last match
-   Random match
-   Round robin
-   Custom

Note that for routes using URI patterns will update the resource
reference's base reference during the routing if they are selected. If
you are using hierarchical paths, remember to directly attach the child
routers to their parent router instead of the top level Restlet
component. Also, remember to manually handle the path separator
characters in your path patterns otherwise the delegation will not work
as expected.

Finally, you can modify the routes list while handling incoming calls as
the delegation code is ensured to be thread-safe.

Server
======

Connector acting as a generic server. It internally uses one of the
available connectors registered with the current Restlet implementation.

Transformer
===========

Filter that can transform XML representations by applying an XSLT
transform sheet.

Uniform
=======

Base class exposing a uniform REST interface.

"The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style
from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface
between components. By applying the software engineering principle of
generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture
is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved.
Implementations are decoupled from the services they provide, which
encourages independent evolvability." Roy T. Fielding

It has many subclasses that focus on a specific ways to handle calls
like filtering, routing or finding a target resource. The context
property is typically provided by a parent component as a way to give
access to features such as logging and client connectors.

Virtual Host
============

Router of calls from Server connectors to Restlets. The attached
Restlets are typically Applications.
