# What's new in version 2.1

## Introduction

In the next sections, you will get a synthesis of the major changes done
to the Restlet Framework in version 2.1. For more details, you can read
the [full list of changes](http://restlet.org/learn/2.1/changes).

The sub-sections will be written when the 2.1 RC1 version is released
only.

## Better documentation

### Restlet in Action book

Finished writing the [Restlet in Action](http://restlet.org/documentation/books) 
book, published by Manning. We made sure that the printed version was
available at the same time as the 2.1.0 release.

## Scalable internal connector

### Non blocking NIO

In version 2.0, we have added support for asynchronous processing of
calls as a preview feature, including provisional responses (1xx status code
in HTTP). This feature was only usable with the internal HTTP connector
that is part of the Restlet engine (org.restlet.jar file), relying on
message queues to support asynchronous handling. However, its IO
processing was still done in a blocking manner, requiring two threads
per connection which limits its scalability, even if persistent
connections and pipelining and now supported.

There, we have started work on a new NIO version of this internal
connector that leverages the non-blocking features of NIO to support a large 
number of concurrent connections and messages with only a single IO thread! The
first results were very promising and we want to complete this connector
in version 2.1 to replace the current internal connector with a lighter,
faster and more scalable one.

### SIP connector

SIP is a core protocol for Voice of IP (VoIP) to control multimedia
session. It has been designed based on the HTTP protocol, using the same
syntax for request and messages and with a similar processing flow,
leveraging a lot provisional responses. We explored over the past months
the possibility to provide a SIP connector based on the same internal 
connector that we use for HTTP and already we
have a prototype working in the Restlet Incubator.

For version 2.1, we want to complete this initial work and make sure its
works and scales properly on top of the new NIO based connector
mentioned above. This will ship as an org.restlet.ext.sip extension. We
also plan to explore a higher-level SIP application API that would
provide a  REST-minded alternative to the SIP Servlets.

## Security enhancements

### Google SDC connector

This protocol allows tunnelling HTTP calls from a public cloud such as
GAE, AWS or any other IaaS, to an intranet protected by a firewall,
without requiring changes to this firewall. See details in [this blog
post](http://blog.restlet.com/2011/03/31/leveraging-sdc-beyond-google-cloud-with-restlet/).

### Google App Engine extension

This extension integrates GAE's authentication service with Restlet's
security API.

### OAuth 2.0 and OpenID 2.0 extensions

See user guide for details.

### CookieAuthenticator

Added to the Crypto extension.

## Multipart HTML forms

The support for composite representations such as multi-part forms, on
both the client and the server side is a recurrent need expressed by
users, we should address it directly in the API or via an extension.

Currently, users rely on the FileUpload extension on the server-side and
on alternative HTTP clients such as Apache HTTP Client 3.1 on the
client-side. It would be much better to have a built-in consistent
solution.

There will also be a focus on facilitating the validation of form
submissions.

## Conneg service

Content negotiation has always been a strong feature of the Restlet
Framework. In version 2.0, its implementation and negotiation algorithm
is fixed in the Restlet Engine. In this new version, we want to make it
customizable via a new ConnegService.

## Eclipse integration

Eclipse is more than an IDE and now provides a comprehensive runtime
platform via the [Eclipse RT](http://www.eclipse.org/rt/)
project. In addition, OSGi and model-driven technologies developed by
the Eclipse foundation nicely fit with the Restlet Framework. In version
2.1, we will help developers to bridge the Restlet and the Eclipse
worlds.

### Model-driven REST

Based on our experience with customers, we believe that the combination
of Restlet and the pragmatic model-driven technologies developed by the
[Eclipse Modeling project](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/)
adds a lot of value. In version 2.1, we will add those new related
extensions:

- EMF extension: to convert EMF representation beans into XML, XMI or HTML
  representations

### Integration with Equinox/OSGi

We continued to mentor/support the ongoing project for [integrating Restlet with Eclipse Equinox](http://blog.restlet.com/2010/05/06/gsoc-and-restlet-integration-with-equinox/)
(OSGi runtime) which is now part of Restlet Incubator.

### Eclipse update site

In addition to our Maven repository, Zip archives and Windows
installers, we want to add a possibility to install and update Restlet
modules and dependent libraries via the Eclipse IDE directly. For this
we will provide an update site. Restlet modules are already OSGi bundles
so this should be straightforward.

## Migration guide from version 2.0 to 2.1

This section intends to explain the main differences between the Restlet
2.0 and 2.1 releases and to help you migrate your existing applications.
Both releases are meant to be compatible at the API level, so you should
at most observe deprecate features while upgrading.

Note that if you intend to migrate directly from 1.1 to 2.1, you should
really consider migrating first from 1.1 to 2.0 and then from 2.0 to
2.1. For migration instructions between 1.1 and 2.0, you can check [this
page](../../../2.0/introduction/whats-new/migration "Migration guide from version 1.1 to 2.0").

### Replace all JAR files

Restlet JARs and dependencies

### Deprecated API features

The next step is to look at each deprecated feature and look in the
Javadocs at the preferred alternative in version 2.1.
