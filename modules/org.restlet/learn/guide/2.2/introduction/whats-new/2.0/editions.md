Editions
========

Introduction
============

The packaging has been reworked to provide **separate distributions for
each edition** that we support: Java SE, Java EE (with Servlet support),
[Google Web
Toolkit](http://blog.restlet.com/2008/07/25/restlet-ported-to-gwt/),
[Google App
Engine](http://blog.restlet.com/2009/04/11/restlet-in-the-cloud-with-google-app-engine/)
and
[Android](http://blog.restlet.com/2009/05/06/restlet-available-on-android-phones/).
In addition, the porting of the main source code base to each edition is
now fully automated, ensuring a constant synchronization in term of
features and bug fixes. All extensions and API features aren’t (or can’t
be) supported in all editions, but the API is consistent. As a side
effect, the “org.restlet.gwt” package has been moved to the regular
“org.restlet” one.

Java SE edition (JSE)
=====================

This is the usual distribution previously available in version 1.1,
without the Servlet related extensions.

Java EE edition (JEE)
=====================

This is the usual distribution previously available in version 1.1,
without the standalone connectors such as Jetty, Grizzly, Netty or
Simple.

Google App Engine edition (GAE)
===============================

This edition is based on the Java EE edition as GAE requires the
deployment of web applications in a constrained Servlet container.

Google Web Toolkit edition (GWT)
================================

GWT object serialization support, based on annotated Restlet interfaces
was also added for the GWT edition, leveraging GWT’s deferred binding
mechanism and GWT-RPC serialization format! [See this related post for
details](http://blog.restlet.com/2009/12/17/restlet-a-restful-middleware-for-gwt-gae-and-android/).
This achieves the same level of productivity than GWT-RPC, in a RESTful
way.

Android edition
===============

Port of the Crypto, Apache HTTP Client, JAAS, JSON, Net extension
(without FTP client).
