# 1.1 extensions

-   Full support for WADL, a popular description language for RESTful
    application. It can be used to configure components, applications
    and resources. In addition, existing Restlet applications can be
    enhanced to dynamically expose a REST API documentation as either a
    raw WADL XML document or as a converted HTML document. This magic
    documentation feature, fully customizable, works by introspecting
    application resources and using an HTML template provided by Yahoo!
    Several features were sponsored by NetDev Ltd.

-   New JAXB extension for easy XML to POJO mappings. JAXB is a standard
    annotation-based API.

-   New JiBX extension providing an efficient and flexible alternative
    to JAXB for XML to object serialization.

-   New Spring extension to provide even more integration possibilities
    with Spring, Servlet and Restlet at the same time. The existing
    Spring API extension has also been improved based on user feed-back
    and contributions.

-   Atom extension has been updated to conform to the latest Atom
    Publishing Protocol specifications. The extension now allows both
    the retrieval and the writing of APP service documents and Atom
    feeds.

-   Extensive implementation of the JAX-RS 1.0 API (developed by
    JSR-311) was contributed by Stephan Koops. We are now waiting for
    access to the TCK for verification of completeness.

-   New OAuth extension was contributed by Adam Rosien, leveraging a new
    pluggable authentication scheme. OAuth is a standard related to
    OpenID for securing API authorization. It is typically used as
    secure way for people to give an application access to their data.

-   New XDB extension providing integration with Oracle embedded JVM
    contributed by Marcelo Ochoa.

-   New Restlet-GWT module provided as a port of the Restlet client API
    to the Google Web Toolkit 1.5 AJAX platform. This module also
    supports HTTP authentication.
