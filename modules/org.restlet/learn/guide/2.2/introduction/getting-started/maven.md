# Getting started with Maven

## Introduction

Maven is a comprehensive project management system built around the
concept of POM (Project Object Model). One of the main advantages is the
automated handling of project dependencies, including their download.
For more information on Maven, check the [project home page](http://maven.apache.org/).

The [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
support appeared to be important for many Restlet users. The initial
response was to automatically generate the POM files for each module JAR
shipped within the Restlet distribution. This enabled users to upload
those JAR files to a local Maven repository, using a script like the one
available in the Wiki.

But, this was clearly not easy enough and forced users to download the
full distribution for each new version released, instead of just
updating a couple of JARs. There also was issues with some third-party
dependencies which aren't available in public Maven repositories, like
the db4o, AsyncWeb or Simple.

That's why it has been decided to launch our dedicated Maven repository.
It is freely accessible from
[http://maven.restlet.org](http://maven.restlet.org/)
and contains all Restlet JARs and third party dependencies that aren't
available in the main public Maven repository.

## Public repository configuration

Here are some instructions about how to configure Maven client to work
with the online Maven repository.

You should have Maven installed.

-   Go to [Maven download
    page](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
-   Download the latest version of Maven and install it on your local
    computer
-   Add Maven bin folder to your PATH

Declare the repository for your project or for a parent project by
updating the *pom.xml* file and adding the following code to the
\<repositories\> section:

    <repository>
       <id>maven-restlet</id>
       <name>Public online Restlet repository</name>
       <url>http://maven.restlet.org</url>
    </repository> 

As an alternative, you can also declare the repository for all of your
projects. Go to the directory on the local computer where you just
install Maven. Open and edit *conf/settings.xml* file. Add to the
\<profiles\> section the following code:

    <profile> 
      <id>restlet</id>
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>maven-restlet</id>
          <name>Public online Restlet repository</name>
          <url>http://maven.restlet.org</url>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
    </profile>

Just after the \</profiles\> add the following:

    <activeProfiles> 
      <activeProfile>restlet</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles> 
       

## Available artifacts

The following table lists the available artifacts and their group and
artifact ids. With the introduction of the
[editions](../../editions "Part III - Restlet Editions")
for the Restlet framework, it is necessary to make a distinction between
an extension for a given edition and the same extension for another
extension simply because the code of the extension may change between
each edition. This distinction is reflected in the group id of each
artifacts which contains a reference to an edition.They are all set on
the same pattern: "org.restlet.\<edition\>" where "\<edition\>" is
three-letters code of an edition among:

-   jse (Java SE edition)
-   jee (Java EE edition),
-   gae (Google App Engine edition),
-   android (Android edition)
-   gwt (google Web Toolkit edition).

You can find [here](../../extensions/editions-matrix "Editions matrix")
a full view of the list of extensions and the editions that ship them.

## Sample dependencies declaration

Each project based on the Restlet Framework needs to declare at least
one dependency: the Restlet core module. According to your needs, you
should complete the list of dependencies with the required extensions
and connectors. For example, assuming your project is a Web server
delivering static files, you need one HTTP server connector such as
Simple. Since your Maven client correctly references the Restlet online
repository, just open and edit the *pom.xml* file for your project and
add the following lines of text into the \<dependencies\> section.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.restlet.jse</groupId>
      <artifactId>org.restlet</artifactId>
      <version>2.2-RC4</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.restlet.jse</groupId>
      <artifactId>org.restlet.ext.simple</artifactId>
      <version>2.2-RC4</version>
    </dependency>
