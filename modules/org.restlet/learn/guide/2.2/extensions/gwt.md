GWT extension
=============

This extension is a server-side integration with GWT 2.5.

It especially supports an object serialization format specific to GWT
and facilitates the exchange of representation beans via Restlet
annotated interfaces. This format is based on the GWT-RPC serialization
mechanism, even though it is used in a regular REST/HTTP way thanks to
[Restlet Framework edition for
GWT](../editions/gwt/ "Restlet edition for Google Web Toolkit")(client-side).

For additional details, please consult the [Javadocs](javadocs://jse/ext/org/restlet/ext/gwt/package-summary.html).
